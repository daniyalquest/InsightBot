for all the interest in big name witnesses and eye opening private text messages at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by dominion voting systems against fox news are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says fox knowingly promoted lies destroying its reputation according to the lawsuit all 20 statements took place between november 8 2020 and january 26 2021 and came in the form of on air comments from fox hosts jeanine pirro lou dobbs and maria bartiromo interviews with prominent pro trump election deniers sidney powell rudy giuliani and mike lindell and several of dobbs tweets the wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories that dominion conducted election fraud that it used algorithms to flip votes that it had ties to venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company the judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false saying it is crystal clear that none of the statements relating to dominion about the 2020 election are true at trial it will be a jury s job to determine if the statements were made with actual malice a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth and potentially award damages dominion has asked for 1 6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages a number fox says is wildly overblown fox has

fox news reached a last second settlement with dominion voting systems on tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements paying more than 787 million to end a colossal two year legal battle that publicly shredded the right wing network s credibility fox news 787 5 million settlement with dominion voting systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in us history involving a media company the deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the delaware superior court rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when after a lunch break the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation while the parties apparently hammered out an accord the parties have resolved their case judge eric davis said before dismissing the 12 member jury crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement effusively praising the lawyers from both sides and gaveling out the so called media trial of the century before it could even begin the groundbreaking settlement represents vindication and accountability dominion lawyer justin nelson said for our democracy to endure for another 250 years and hopefully much longer we must share a commitment to facts today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy the right wing network said in a statement that it acknowledge s the court s rulings finding certain claims about dominion to be false referring to davis recent ruling that 20 fox news broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that dominion rigged the presidential election but fox won t have to admit on air that it spread lies about dominion a dominion representative told cnn the 787 5 million payout is roughly half of the 1 6 billion that dominion initially sought though it is nearly 10 times the company s valuation from 2018 and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021 according to court filings the last minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won t proceed to trial by settling with dominion influential fox news executives and prominent on air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage which was filled with lies about voter fraud the witness list included fox corporation chairman rupert murdoch his ceo son lachlan murdoch and top fox hosts like sean hannity and tucker carlson damning emails texts and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures and many others at fox privately said in 2020 that the vote rigging claims against dominion were asinine but the lies were spread on air anyway rupert murdoch thought the election denialism was really crazy even as fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers carlson said he passionately hates donald trump whose presidency was a disaster fox hosts producers fact checkers and senior executives privately said in the on air claims of a stolen election were kooky dangerously reckless and mind blowingly nuts these revelations generated months of blistering headlines for fox as the case moved toward trial by settling now fox deprived dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks long trial this settlement reflects fox s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards fox said in a statement tuesday we are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with dominion amicably instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial allows the country to move forward from these issues fox news and fox corporation its parent company which was also a defendant maintain they never defamed dominion and say the case was a meritless assault on first amendment press freedoms speculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days especially after the court on sunday announced a one day delay to the start of the trial which was originally set to begin on monday the jury selection process wrapped up as planned tuesday morning and both sides prepped for opening statements they even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations but when the proceedings didn t promptly resume after lunch the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom looking at their phones and waiting the racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court ready for their front row seat to a historic trial but davis the judge instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement your presence here short compared to what you thought and uneventful in a certain sense was extremely important davis said without you the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation many on the dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself fox has admitted to telling lies about dominion that caused enormous damage to my company our employees and the customers that we serve dominion ceo john poulos said tuesday outside court related article tucker carlson passionately hates trump and eight more key revelations about fox news from new dominion filings while the dominion case is now over fox news is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from smartmatic another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on fox news shows after the 2020 election that case is still in the discovery process and a trial isn t expected anytime soon for its part dominion still has pending lawsuits against right wing tv networks newsmax and oan as well as against trump

millions of americans could face massive consequences unless speaker kevin mccarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for president joe biden that is instead threatening to capture his house republicans the california republican traveled to wall street on monday to deliver a fresh warning that the house gop majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his white house legacy mccarthy also assured traders however that he would never let the us government default on its obligations a potential disaster that could halt social security payments trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised related article lawmakers return to washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom this is where the risk to americans comes in it s hard to see how a rookie speaker with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists can engineer either of these outcomes most countries don t require the legislature to raise the government s borrowing threshold but the quirky situation in the us has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age since the government spends more than it makes in revenue it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that congress has already authorized it has no problem getting more credit since the us pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default at least that s the way it has worked until now mccarthy beseeched his conference in a closed door meeting on tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from biden he styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table but the bill is purely tactical since it s got no chance of passing the democratic led senate but in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among gop members rep scott perry the chairman of the hardline house freedom caucus was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts i don t know what s in the package completely that s the issue perry told reporters some members seem reluctant to commit so far conservative rep tim burchett told cnn s manu raju i m open to it but i m still a no vote it is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed and house financial services chair patrick mchenry a mccarthy ally was confident the plan would pass the house the question is what does the white house then do once we pass this package we ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the house he added so we ll have the first opening offer here and we ll see if the president s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have mchenry s comment however reflected a big flaw in the gop strategy since it relies on mccarthy s belief that biden will have no choice but to come to the table the white house has insisted the house should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit in effect mccarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a house where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious gop can agree on what programs to cut and by how much and even if the measure does squeeze through the house in the coming weeks it will likely be an idealized republican product on which biden and the democratic senate will never bite any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its gop support still the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted monday he d have the votes to pass his initial bill i think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling mccarthy told cnn we ve got a lot of consensus within the conference we ll get together and work through it related article house republicans in talks over one year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge white house his assurances may not be very reassuring however because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in january degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams but with the debt ceiling it will be americans livelihoods and the global economy rather than mccarthy s immediate political ambitions that are on the line so far republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves let alone biden republican rep dusty johnson of south dakota who is helping to fashion the gop s position said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week challenges remain i think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that of course we all want to see worked in johnson told cnn s manu raju the reality is that in a negotiation you never get everything you want and so i think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks related article house gop escalates defense of trump with new york field hearing seeking to discredit manhattan da another complication is that some members of the republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle no matter what in a powerful republican majority such holdouts could be ignored in mccarthy s narrow majority secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of gop expectations they have real leverage and democrats have little incentive to help mccarthy out in the event of gop defections since they d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that biden has opposed in any final gop bill and the speaker probably couldn t risk using democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule as he battled to win his job that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster the coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two year period of uneasy cohabitation between the democratic president and republican speaker neither biden nor mccarthy can afford to lose and the outcome will shape both their legacies there is nothing wrong with republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending there are some gop lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits even when their party runs government plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt which has crashed through 31 trillion and biden s big spending on covid relief packages infrastructure climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis but are republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs market linked pension plans and the economic well being of millions are at risk the absolutist nature of mccarthy s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power democrats control the white house and the senate so in handing republicans the house albeit barely voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation republicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy since they had little problem raising the debt limit when donald trump who rarely worried about making a big spending splash was president the 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his white house days saying he couldn t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a negotiating wedge republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the oval office in order to prevail in this fight mccarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff he tried to do so on monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the us economy wasn t a default but rising national debt without exaggeration american debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action yet how has president biden reacted to this issue he has done nothing so in my view and i think the rest of america it s irresponsible he said previous fiscal showdowns between gop controlled congresses and democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on republicans presidents bill clinton and barack obama for example branded their foes in the house as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction mccarthy needs to reverse the equation which is why he s trying to portray biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling the two men haven t met for the last 75 days and the white house is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget which house republicans are yet to produce and not with the full faith and credit of the us government on the line and with america s reputation as a financial haven at stake mccarthy is therefore in a bind congress not the president has the power to raise the government s borrowing limit yet the speaker is demanding biden give away his store over a duty that only mccarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill no one would benefit from a default especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race but it s hard to see how mccarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown the white house twisted that particular knife on monday there is one responsible solution to the debt limit addressing it promptly without brinksmanship or hostage taking as republicans did three times in the last administration and as presidents trump and reagan argued for in office spokesman andrew bates said republicans in the senate have so far tried to avoid the mess but senate republican leader mitch mcconnell did at least give his colleague in the house some moral support on monday when he returned to the capitol after convalescing after a fall president biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen talk or negotiate and the american people know that the white house needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the speaker of the house mcconnell said though notably didn t volunteer to get involved mccarthy s speech on monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is after months of simmering moving toward a boil as senate democratic majority leader chuck schumer of new york put it on monday he went all the way to wall street and gave us no more details no more facts no new information and i ll be blunt if speaker mccarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default cnn s melanie zanona morgan rimmer haley talbot and lauren fox contributed to this report
the 84 year old white man accused of shooting a black teenager who rang his doorbell in kansas city turned himself in tuesday and was later released on bail authorities said andrew lester who faces two felony charges assault in the first degree and armed criminal action in the april 13 shooting of ralph yarl will be arraigned wednesday afternoon according to yarl family attorney lee merritt cnn has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information lester turned himself in at a detention center tuesday then hours later was released on bail the conditions of his 200 000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with yarl or his family according to clay county sheriff s office spokesperson sarah boyd ralph 16 was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings he has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery his family said lester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door cnn has not been able to reach the homeowner cnn has yet to determine whether lester has an attorney the criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to ralph s family but long roads lie ahead both with ralph s recovery and the quest for justice his aunt faith spoonmore told cnn it s not as simple as turning a page spoonmore said tuesday it s a little better that he is hopefully going to get part of what of he deserves but questions remain over why lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the april 13 shooting i share the outrage and concern of many in asking why kansas city mayor quinton lucas told cnn in missouri you can have a 24 hour hold it is clear here that this was two or three hours where they questioned the suspect he was able to go back home that evening lester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw ralph pulling on an exterior door handle according to the probable cause document obtained by cnn lester thought ralph was trying to break in to the home and was scared to death due to the boy s size according to the document officers responded just before 10 p m that night after receiving reports of a shooting when they arrived they found ralph wounded in the street the shooting left ralph who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school with gunshot wounds to his head and arm while he was hospitalized ralph told police he did not pull on the door according to the document it was nothing short of a miracle that ralph was discharged from the hospital his attorney ben crump told cnn on monday but he s not out of the woods yet the shooting fueled protests in kansas city and stirred memories of trayvon martin and ahmaud arbery young black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self defense demonstrators have marched through kansas city chanting justice for ralph and calling for the shooter s arrest the shooting also came days before a 20 year old woman was shot and killed in upstate new york after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway related article a 20 year old woman was shot and killed after accidentally turning into the wrong driveway in upstate new york officials say while ralph s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter it remains unclear whether missouri s stand your ground law will be cited in lester s defense case stand your ground laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be ralph s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew s size could be a threat i really don t understand how spoonmore said i doubt ralph is even 170 pounds ralph is not even 6 feet tall she said she s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew i want justice to look the same across the board spoonmore said i want justice to look the same the mayor said he believes ralph was racially profiled by the shooter this boy was shot because he was existing while black lucas said clay county prosecuting attorney zachary thompson has said there was a racial component to this case but did not elaborate on the night of the shooting lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later two representatives at the kansas city police department detention unit previously told cnn lester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done thompson said attorney crump questioned why lester was not detained longer nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed and you had a black man shoot a white 16 year old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested i mean this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young black kid in the head crump told cnn he merely rang the doorbell that was it the teen s attorney said and the owner of the home shoots through the door hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time the mayor said he didn t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting and while he believes race played a role in the shooting he acknowledged the work by police including white officers who helped prosecutors file charges against lester we did have officers white officers for what it s worth who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter lucas said that being said to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand before the shooting lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his 32 caliber revolver he told police according to a probable cause statement he then went to his home s front entrance which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door both of which were locked lester opened the interior door and saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle lester told police he stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door the probable cause statement reads he believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in the document reads lester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting according to the document police spoke with ralph while he was being treated at a hospital where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 ne 115th street according to the document which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 ne 115th terrace when he arrived at the house on 115th street ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head causing him to fall the document says while the teenager was still on the ground the man then fired again shooting him in the arm ralph told police ralph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot and he heard the man say don t come around here the document says he then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police related article how trayvon martin s life and death inspired a generation to fight for justice the boy told police he did not pull on the door according to the probable cause document responding officers also found the front storm door glass at lester s home broken with blood on the front porch and the driveway according to the document the teen had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up a gofundme page started by ralph s aunt states a neighbor who asked not to be identified told cnn she called 911 after ralph came to her door bleeding since the shooter s location was unknown at the time she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety she said she complied initially then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding this is somebody s child i had to clean blood off of my door off of my railing that was someone s child s blood she said i m a mom this is not ok ralph is still traumatized from the ordeal but the family hopes for a full recovery because ralph is young and strong crump said he and his family are just happy that he s alive after being shot in the head crump told cnn merritt said tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into yarl s upper temple and penetrated his skull they scraped bullet fragments off his frontal lobe on thursday on saturday he was home playing with his dog merritt said he said god was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual that was in fact a miracle what are we supposed to learn from that miracle is the question we need to answer ralph a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting west africa before starting college according to the gofundme page related article for black residents of ahmaud arbery s hometown trust in the justice system is on trial right alongside his accused killers life looks a lot different right now even though he is doing well physically he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally the trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable the aunt wrote in the fundraiser the gofundme page started to help the family with medical expenses had garnered more than 2 million in donations by monday night crump likened ralph s shooting to the shootings of 17 year old martin in florida and 25 year old arbery in georgia we continue to fight to say you can t profile and shoot our children just because you have this stand your ground law crump said unacceptable merritt told cnn monday that the stand your ground action would not apply to ralph s case the stand your ground action under the laws of missouri are completely inapplicable to this case because there has been no conversation not from the suspect not from the victim and not from law enforcement that ralph yarl at 16 years old ever posed a threat to this shooter merritt said president joe biden spoke with ralph and his mother cleo nagbe by phone on monday evening a white house official told cnn biden also noted how fortunate ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse but also a physical therapist the conversation also covered their families their love of music and ralph s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at texas a m university to which biden lightheartedly attempted to convince him that the president s alma mater university of delaware was a much better option the

at some middle and high schools in the united states 1 in 4 teens report they ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior a new study found this is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school and we found a tremendous wide range of misuse said lead author sean esteban mccabe director of the center for the study of drugs alcohol smoking and health at the university of michigan in ann arbor related article prescriptions for adhd treatments surged during the covid 19 pandemic cdc report shows in some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants while in other schools more than 25 of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways said mccabe who is also a professor of nursing at the university of michigan school of nursing this study is a major wake up call nonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high prior studies have found students also overuse medications or use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers said pediatrician dr deepa camenga associate director of pediatric programs at the yale program in addiction medicine in new haven connecticut we know this is happening in colleges a major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools not just college said camenga who was not involved with the study published tuesday in the journal jama network open the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by monitoring the future a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975 in the data set used for this study questionnaires were given to more than 230 000 teens in eighth 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3 284 secondary schools related article adderall users struggle with ongoing shortage while reason and resolution remain uncertain schools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed adhd medications were about 36 more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year the study found schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue but it didn t disappear mccabe said we know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications perhaps from family members such as siblings and asking peers who may attend other schools he said schools in the suburbs in all regions of the united states except the northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of adhd medications as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree according to the study schools with more white students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants on an individual level students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse adhd medications than teens who did not use weed according to the analysis in addition adolescents who said they used adhd medications currently or in the past were about 2 5 more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants the study found but these findings were not being driven solely by teens with adhd misusing their medications mccabe said we still found a significant association even when we excluded students who were never prescribed adhd therapy data collection for the study was through 2020 since then new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10 during 2021 across most age groups at the same time there has been a nationwide shortage of adderall one of the most popular adhd drugs leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions the stakes are high taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder which can lead to anxiety depression psychosis and seizures experts say related article the benefits of body doubling when you have adhd according to experts if overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs there can be sudden health consequences side effects can include paranoia dangerously high body temperatures and an irregular heartbeat especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration research has also shown people who misuse adhd medications are highly likely to have multiple substance use disorders abuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades experts say as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for adhd mccabe said for children with adhd who use their medications appropriately stimulants can be effective treatment they are protective for the health of a child camenga said those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders the solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them mccabe stressed instead we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse he said parents can make sure the schools their kids attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies and ask about prevalence of misuse that data is available for every school families can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all night study session he added you d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say mccabe said parents can role play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens parents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills he added finally if parents suspect any type of misuse they should contact their child s prescriber right away mccabe said that child should be screened and assessed immediately

senate democrats railed against justice clarence thomas on tuesday amid reports that the supreme court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel gifts and a real estate transaction involving a gop megadonor but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear senate judiciary chairman dick durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks but shared no details when pressed by cnn on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor texas based billionaire harlan crow related article clarence thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to gop megadonor asked if subpoenas were on the table durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet he said that it was too soon to share more information about what his committee s hearing on supreme court ethics might look like he and other judiciary democrats sent a letter to chief justice john roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the thomas allegations sen richard blumenthal a connecticut democrat who sits on the judiciary committee told reporters tuesday that the american people deserve all of the facts surrounding justice thomas s blatant violation of law i hope that thomas will voluntarily appear and if not we should consider subpoenas for him and others like harlan crow who have information blumenthal said other democrats on the committee said tuesday that they were deferring to durbin who huddled with democrats on monday evening to discuss their strategy towards thomas meanwhile republicans appear mostly united in defending the thomas suggesting the court can handle its own affairs senate minority leader mitch mcconnell attacked democrats for criticizing the court and said he has confidence in roberts to deal with these court internal issues the democrats it seems to me spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution mcconnell told reporters tuesday bringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past but the court s jerk to the right particularly with the three justices that former president donald trump put on the bench has raised the partisan stakes around the issue in recent years the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies all prompting outcry from democrats even as senate democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the thomas allegations they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code of ethics for the supreme court which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary i m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical even potentially illegal conduct at the highest levels of our judiciary sen alex padilla a california democrat said at a judiciary committee hearing for three lower court nominees on tuesday it should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards durbin said in a speech that congress shouldn t have to wait for the court to act the supreme court doesn t need to wait on congress to clean up its act the justices could take action today if they wanted to and if the court fails to act congress must durbin an illinois democrat said on the senate floor tuesday back to back reports in propublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to thomas from crow and even a real estate transaction went unreported in thomas annual financial disclosures thomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so under an exemption in the court s disclosure rules for so called personal hospitality after scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers the judicial conference which operates as the policy making body for the federal judiciary recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality thomas received thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future and a source close to the justice also told cnn in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction the sale of his mother s home to crow if the reports are accurate it stinks sen mitt romney said monday evening in rare comments from a republican criticizing thomas lack of transparency other republicans lined up in defense of the justice who was named to the supreme court by president george h w bush in 1991 and said it wasn t congress place to push an ethics code on the high court related article gop revolts against plan to replace feinstein on key panel in push to block biden judicial picks sen josh hawley a republican member of the judiciary committee suggested that the accusations against thomas were part of a multi decade effort now to

conservative activist was texting with trump white house chief of staff mark meadows about the former president s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases yet republicans have shown little interest in joining democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices the court kind of historically i think has sort of policed itself said south dakota sen john thune the gop s senate whip who said thomas had been a solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there let s see what the court does south carolina sen lindsey graham the top republican on the judiciary committee told cnn tuesday i prefer them to do it

have recanted the claim suggesting he was blackmailed into making it azamat uldarov a former convict made his retraction in a video call with the russian news agency ria fan it s unclear if there were any conditions to the interview he and another former convict alexey savichev previously gave long and rambling interviews to russian human rights group gulagu net saying they were among the tens of thousands of wagner fighters recruited from russian jails to fight in ukraine speaking with gulagu founder vladimir osechkin uldarov said he shot and killed a young girl calling it a management decision i wasn t allowed to let anyone out alive because my command was to kill anything in my way he said estimating that the girl was five or six years old in his interview with ria fan which is associated with wagner group leader yevgeny prigozhin uldarov said he was drunk when he gave the interview and alleged that osechkin had blackmailed him about his time in prison asked by ria fan they

engage in any serious negotiations the official said and the process may take a long time on tuesday a russian court denied gershkovich s appeal to serve out his pre trial detention under house arrest rather than at the notorious lefortovo prison he will be held there until at least may 29 and faces a prison sentence of up to 20 years on espionage charges that the us has strongly condemned calling the lack of regular consular access for gershkovich appalling the senior administration official said that the us hasn t heard specific concerns about the conditions of the us national s detention but said that his detention writ large is inhumane the us state department has officially designated gershkovich as wrongfully detained by russia i think the starting point for our position on this

the family of virginia giuffre who became the most prominent victim of jeffrey epstein has told the bbc that lord mandelson should never have been given the position of uk ambassador to the united states in an exclusive interview on sunday with laura kuenssberg virginia s brother sky roberts said the appointment speaks to how deep the corruption goes in our systems business secretary peter kyle told the bbc it was highly unlikely lord mandelson would have been appointed if the extent of his relationship with epstein was known to those in government there is no suggestion that lord mandelson ever met giuffre he said last week that perhaps as a gay man he never sought or was offered introductions to women from epstein lord mandelson was sacked by the prime minister this week after the publication of emails showed the labour peer sent supportive messages to epstein as he faced jail for sex offences in 2008 speaking on the programme kyle said it was extremely distressing to watch the interview with giuffre s family he said at the time mandelson was appointed the uk us relationship was in a perilous state and britain needed somebody with outstanding singular talents kyle said a lot was known about lord mandelson s relationship with epstein during the vetting process and on balance the decision was taken to appoint him when asked if the appointment was a mistake kyle said they giuffre s family say it was a mistake and retrospectively if we had known the information that we know now it is highly unlikely that he would have been appointed because what we know now is materially different to what we understood at the time virginia giuffre alleged that she was abused by jeffrey epstein after she met ghislaine maxwell a british socialite in 2000 while working as a locker room attendant at donald trump s mar a lago resort in palm beach in 2001 at the age of 17 she said epstein brought her to london and introduced her to prince andrew who she claimed sexually abused her three times the prince who has denied all claims against him reached an out of court settlement with her in 2022 which contained no admission of liability or apology after many years of campaigning she had become the most prominent victim of jeffrey epstein giuffre took her own life in april giuffre s sister in law amanda roberts told the bbc why does it take us to have to pull out the skeletons for people to be held accountable our governments have allowed these people to hold their status and their title without shame he should never have been given that title we have to put the spotlight on them it s unfair we continuously pull these skeletons out that survivors have to continuously point the finger for us to do the right thing neither downing street nor lord mandelson wished to comment lord mandelson s sacking came after a cache of emails between the labour peer and epstein was published by bloomberg in the emails the peer urged epstein to fight for early release and revealed the extent of their contacts and relationship mr roberts virginia s younger brother said that the firing of mandelson was a step in the right direction but the reality is that s not nearly enough referencing jeffrey epstein s birthday book to which peter mandelson contributed several pages along with dozens of other contributors he added there are still people out there still people in that book who could be doing this to other young women and children right now entries from 40 people divided into several categories such as friends business science and brooklyn were published though the names under family and girl friends were redacted these people are not accused of any legal wrongdoing in connection with epstein s case the family s first uk interview was broadcast on sunday with laura kuenssberg as well as lord mandelson they discuss epstein donald trump and prince andrew and their hope for virginia s legacy sign up for the off air with laura k newsletter to get laura kuenssberg s expert insight and insider stories every week emailed directly to you
what a week what a mess a senior labour mp is not the only one in disbelief at the latest you couldn t make it up mishap for this government how downing street handled revelations about lord mandelson s friendship with the wealthy paedophile jeffrey epstein was the first test of the new senior team in no 10 the uncharitable view is they flunked it by not acting quickly enough putting the prime minister s face on the calamity by sending him into the bearpit of prime minister s questions pmqs with a staunch defence of his man in washington they knew there were new allegations about his relationship with epstein the direction of travel seemed set and mandelson would likely have to go the even more uncomfortable factor is that last week the prime minister defended another colleague angela rayner when you guessed it the direction of travel in westminster seemed set and she would likely have to go it s undermined the prime minister s own authority and blown the chance of a quick autumn reset for labour when the party was desperately trying to turn the page the more generous argument made by sir keir s allies he s been let down by two different people in two different ways and has had to front up to clean up their different messes keir is frustrated and a bit angry because he is having to deal with the conduct of others rather than show what he is trying to do one source says another says he hired someone who didn t tell him the full truth no 10 doesn t imagine that the damage of the last fortnight of farce is limited to those who have departed government and as they absorb the scale of the embarrassment over mandelson s friendship with epstein new details over who knew what and when are emerging all the time westminster sources have suggested the prime minister himself had raised questions about mandelson s links with epstein during an initial vetting process carried out by the cabinet office before he was given the job but then he was checked out again by the foreign office once he d been appointed even before labour won the election in 2024 there had been a desire in sir keir s circle to look beyond the traditional diplomatic appointment for their ambassador to the white house one of the government s plum jobs they had noted how the former australian prime minister kevin rudd was sent to dc and determined that a politician could be the right choice with his experience as a trade commissioner an impressive spider s web of contacts and respected political nous mandelson was soon determined to be an excellent potential fit sir keir s powerful chief of staff morgan mcsweeney believed there were only two qualified candidates for the role and was enthusiastic about mandelson before the final decision was made last autumn the cabinet office was asked as it would be for any such candidate to consider whether he was fit to be offered the job already at that stage it was no secret mandelson had been friends with epstein so it was obvious those links would need to be considered i m told a file on mandelson from the cabinet office s propriety and ethics team pet whose job it is to know where the bodies are buried in whitehall was presented to the prime minister that included information about his relationship with the disgraced millionaire on reading this file sir keir had three questions he wanted to clarify with the peer a no 10 source tells me why had he continued his friendship with epstein after he was first convicted and not broken contact with him why had he stayed at one of epstein s houses when the financier was in jail and was he a founding citizen of an ocean conservation charity that epstein had backed that trio of questions was put to mandelson in an email from sir keir s chief of staff mcsweeney on his behalf the peer i m told replied to those questions in an email in which downing street sources now say he was economical with the truth it s understood mandelson believes that he was truthful and frank about his association with epstein and told no 10 that he had not stayed in epstein s manhattan apartment in 2009 while epstein was in prison another source confirmed that he told downing street he had not stayed there court documents revealed in 2023 epstein told his private banker that mandelson would be staying at the property mandelson has never explicitly denied or confirmed he did although it has been reported that he had no recollection of doing so it s worth noting that none of those issues the possible house stay the charity or the continued friendship were discovered during the vetting process they had been reported in previous years but the guarantees relayed to the prime minister by mandelson were considered sufficient to be worth the gamble of giving him the job once the appointment was then made sources suggest the developed vetting process then kicked in under the auspices of the foreign office the normal process for government appointments is dependent on the job being given and the sensitivity of the material and information to be handled but there is scarcely a job with a higher level of trust required than the white house ambassador given the two countries links on security defence trade and intelligence i m told nothing was flagged to no 10 as a result of the dv process which would have involved an in person interview which in this case ought to have been completely forensic but they must have used the wrong lens according to another senior figure unlike the pet file downing street would not receive the results of such a process as a matter of course even in an extremely high profile appointment the dv process is a standalone routine and downing street sources insist that they weren t made aware of any problems so everything went ahead the upshot even though there were two different processes checking out mandelson s background which publicly was known to include dealings with a notorious wealthy sex offender neither appear to have turned up anything major nor the now notorious emails which investigative reporters were able to locate recently one whitehall insider told me it was staggering either they skipped the process of any basic due diligence or they did that process and missed the obvious questions no one involved in making the appointment cared enough to check whether all the risk had been identified in appointing a man who had twice previously had to resign over his judgement careless doesn t cover it the government has repeatedly said this week that part of the problem was the messages between mandelson and epstein were from a defunct email address yet a senior whitehall figure tells me it would have been possible to locate those messages had more questions been asked and forensic background digging been done neither downing street nor the cabinet office wanted to comment until this week it seemed no 10 s calculated risk of appointing mandelson was paying off not just because us president donald trump appeared to enjoy his company praising his beautiful accent on camera recently in the oval office but also because the uk had got its trade deal the state visit was all about to unfold in its pomp and glory sir keir appeared unlike many other global leaders to have managed to build a warm and functional relationship with the most powerful man in the western world all of that at least partly down to the smooth talking and politicking of the ambassador what he and no 10 were enjoying as a successful tenure was to be suddenly disrupted when the peer featured in what s known as the epstein birthday book it features a cosy message mandelson branding epstein his best pal and a photograph of the two in which mandelson is wearing a bathrobe and what was to prove more serious reporters at the news agency bloomberg managed to get hold of a cache of epstein s emails which included his communications with mandelson over months and years in an attempt to get ahead of the story mandelson predicted that a whole slew of contact between the two was about to emerge into public view and he described the revelations to the sun as very embarrassing this sent alarm bells clanging back in whitehall he hadn t shared the contents of the emails with downing street and had been dismissive claiming there was nothing new in the stories emerging about his friendship with epstein earlier in the week sources suggest but by late on tuesday the government was aware that more damaging allegations were coming and contacted the peer to ask what was going on on wednesday morning mandelson s prediction of there being more to come was first reported just as in the normal routine no 10 was planning the day and preparing the prime minister for his weekly pmqs bout in the commons at noon before government had heard back from lord mandelson the prime minister gave a staunch public defence of him in a move that now looks foolhardy but when mandelson did reply after pmq s the government didn t think his answers were good enough the prime minister s chief of staff mcsweeney was called out of a meeting in a secure room in whitehall where mobile communications are forbidden sources suggest the decision was made soon after to ask mandelson to resign he refused trying to brazen it out sources suggest he kept telling everyone it would be fine on wednesday no 10 was also trying to weigh up the impact of losing the ambassador on the crucial state visit of the us president just days away and also what the legal ramifications would be of forcing mandelson out but later on wednesday night the full extent of those emails were published by bloomberg and the prime minister read the exchanges in all their gory glory keir was furious i m told and on thursday morning he made the formal decision with the foreign secretary that if labour s veteran fixer wouldn t go on his own accord he d be sacked on friday the prime minister was working at his country retreat chequers mulling over his conference speech for which sir keir has picked up the pen in a more proactive way than in times gone by aware this is a moment when the pressure to lift the mood and show his worth is intense after a first year in office that disappointed many in the labour party and left them in the polling doldrums his big moment on the podium at conference was already set to be a high wire act after this chaotic fortnight it s fortuitous we are heading to conference and we can grab the mic one insider said another senior figure told me i don t see problems that aren t fixable but when it comes to lord mandelson the clamour may take some time to fade this isn t over no 10 is in total denial a party insider said a different prominent source told me the mandelson mess is just another big misstep alongside sir keir there is also growing disquiet about the prime minister s chief of staff mcsweeney it s no secret he was keen to appoint mandelson even though he and the prime minister did have questions about his relationship with epstein but sources dispute he was trying save the us ambassador from his fate this week it s said he agreed on wednesday lunchtime mandelson had to go before travelling to brussels for meetings leaving him out of the country when the final call to sack him was made when politicians are down powerful staffers often become a target opposition politicians and critics on the inside can even appear to enjoy the hunt for someone to blame however mcsweeney is central to sir keir s leadership if there s no morgan there s no starmer one senior labour figure said warning mps warming up to point the finger to be careful about where it all might lead after a dreadful start of what should have been a shiny new political season one cabinet minister says in sorrow we have made the right big strategic calls but there is just no way that we should be in this position after a year but others believe all is not lost just as labour slumped in popularity at breakneck speed after winning the election senior figures suggest their fortunes could improve dramatically quickly too volatility in politics can be governments enemy but also potentially be their friend yet right now it s hard to see where labour can find much comfort there is little option but to keep going to focus on what insiders characterise as good announcements coming in the next few weeks presenting a huge opportunity for the prime minister to shift the dial and boost the party s confidence but one minister joked after a shocking fortnight for the government i keep thinking maybe it s all a very detailed dream and i ll wake up but then no this is reality and we just have to get on with it they certainly do lead photo image alberto pezzali pool via reuters ben pruchnie getty images

us president donald trump is going to be greeted with a spectacular royal charm offensive during his state visit this week the aim will be to dazzle and flatter him with the ultimate red carpet experience with guards of honour flypasts historic carriages a lavish banquet pomp and pageantry in return sir keir starmer will be hoping this gilt edged reception will help to deliver the uk s message on awkward issues such as ukraine and trade tariffs and if anyone can get the us president s attention and influence him surely king charles iii and the royal family can but how will king charles handle his sometimes unpredictable guest in windsor can he be the trump whisperer trump loves the monarchy and the royal family it s a potential diplomatic ace card for the uk government says anna whitelock professor of history of the modern monarchy at city st george s university of london this attraction to royalty will give the king a rare advantage in dealing with trump who usually expects to have the upper hand says prof whitelock sir anthony seldon biographer of the uk s prime ministers agrees the king can benefit from trump s palpable enthusiasm for the royals he says at the same time king charles is in the most delicate of positions his own known views on the environment and standing up for democracy and the rule of law in europe are a long way apart from the president s says sir anthony he will i am sure be scrupulously correct and civil he adds in essence the king will stick to the script given to him by the uk government the government will certainly hope that this week s royal schmooze fest will make a positive impression on trump creating a feelgood factor for the uk it s an unusual and carefully crafted state visit there s a crammed schedule squeezed into a day and a half most of it dedicated to royal spectacles windsor is being used like a royal theme park with fears over security and protests there won t be any cheering crowds and no public procession like the one recently enjoyed by france s president emmanuel macron instead it will be helicopters and closed events including the carriage ride which will wind its way inside the windsor estate a yougov poll over the summer showed opinion divided on whether trump s visit should go ahead with slightly more wanting it cancelled and the nearest thing to the public that the president will see will be the staff working at the banquet the king will make a speech in honour of the president at the state banquet in st george s hall inside windsor castle he s likely to praise the special relationship and talk of the anniversaries of wartime alliances perhaps mentioning his mother the late queen and trump s mother who so admired royalty every word will have been written in close consultation with the government anxious to hit the right notes guests including many celebrity faces will dine on a showcase of us and british food from a menu written in french with five or six different glasses for each place in a hall lined with royal portraits and suits of armour charles has decades of experience at playing host whatever his own private thoughts and he s not exactly going to be signed up to trump s drill baby drill message the king has a strong sense of duty and will work hard to make this visit a success royal author robert hardman suggests they ll stick to safe topics such as talking about the president s scottish roots and the royals have of course had plenty of visits from people with whom they might not have seen eye to eye mr hardman describes how the late queen elizabeth ii once hid behind a bush rather than bump into romania s president caecescu in the palace gardens during the dictator s state visit in 1978 the king is also not alone the rest of the royal family will be deployed to help with the hospitality all eyes will be on catherine the princess of wales and the first lady melania trump when they visit a nature project involving the scouts on thursday trump is also an admirer of prince william praising their great great talk in france at the re opening of the notre dame cathedral william and catherine will be an important part of the ceremonial welcome on wednesday queen camilla will show melania one of the quirkier items in windsor a remarkable dolls house made a century ago by the architect sir edwin lutyens if things get too tough the miniature wine bottles in the dolls house have real drink inside while king charles and trump might seem contrasting personalities they re very much known quantities to each other they re men of the same post war generation trump aged 79 and the king aged 76 who have overlapped for decades as far back as the late 1980s charles had been to trump s mar a lago estate after trump survived an assassination attempt last july the king sent him a personal note they spent time together during trump s previous state visit in 2019 and it s also not just the two heads of state who have crossed paths but their families before trump had taken a tilt at the white house his businessman brother robert who died in 2020 had been a significant donor to charles s charities bringing him to royal dinners in the uk along with other wealthy us socialites the king s brother prince andrew had visited mar a lago in 2000 introducing himself as andrew york to guests jeffrey epstein later convicted as a sex offender and ghislaine maxwell were pictured at the same party prince andrew will be entirely airbrushed out of this week s visit but for trump s 2019 visit he was described as buckingham palace s secret weapon accompanying the president on two of the three days that was only a matter of months before the duke of york s notorious newsnight interview trump clearly relished meeting the late queen elizabeth ii and he ll pay his respects to her laying a wreath on her tomb in st george s chapel trump s fascination with the monarchy is at the heart of this state visit as with much about the president it s about his personality more than his politics i still remember my mother who is scottish by birth sitting in front of the television set to watch queen elizabeth s coronation and not budging for an entire day she was just enthralled by the pomp and circumstance the whole idea of royalty and glamour trump recalled in his book the art of the deal i also remember my father that day pacing around impatiently for christ s sake mary he d say enough is enough turn it off it seems to be his mother s voice that he listened to a meeting with the queen of england was the ultimate sign that he trump had made it in life wrote his former russia adviser fiona hill in her white house memoir for trump getting close to a king or queen seems to have been the ultimate way for an outsider to become an insider offering him a second state visit has been called unprecedented and it is very rare although queen margrethe and prince henrik of denmark also had two in 1974 and 2000 since the start of queen elizabeth ii s reign in 1952 there have only been three state visits by us presidents george w bush barack obama and trump who is the only one who has had two there have been other presidential trips to the uk but not fully fledged state visits the significance of that shouldn t be underestimated and it reflects how much trump dominates the international news agenda for the uk government his apparent fandom for the royals creates an opportunity to make its own pitch to trump it s an important moment for king charles who used to be criticised for meddling in politics now he s in the unusual position of being actively encouraged to play a role in diplomatic negotiations soft power is being applied to tough times it was the king who embraced ukraine s president zelensky after his white house mauling in february and it was the king who went to canada in may to show solidarity when it was under pressure from trump to become his 51st state charles appears to have been effective former canadian high commissioner to the uk jeremy kinsman said the intervention had been outstanding and trump seems to have reduced his aggressive rhetoric the king has also received warm support and standing ovations after speeches to the parliaments of france italy and germany charles is a bridge builder in an era when populist politicians are burning them down yet issues such as protecting ukraine are personally and deeply held by the king i imagine it is an uncomfortable moment for the king adds mr kinsman i cannot imagine two men more utterly different in values purpose style and psychology mr kinsman the former professional diplomat says the king will have been briefed to play the genial host and continue to try to charm the us president and impress him with the majesty of the setting in turn he says trump will be on best behaviour and he will have been briefed and ready for small talk on topics such as organic farming the king will know what to expect and i m confident he will handle the president very diplomatically royal commentator pauline maclaran says the chemistry between them will be very interesting sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis

friendship feels like it s spiralling out of control it s that time of life where everyone is getting engaged married or having kids lucy says and the costs of celebrating all of that adds up money doesn t grow on trees adds charles who s 27 lots of my friends work in the public sector and it s a struggle to keep up so what are the pitfalls when organising a hen a stag or even a wedding and is there a way to keep everyone happy one common theme is that people feel pressured into saying yes to attending to avoid upsetting friends or worse looking cheap i see tiktoks all the time saying just say no it s so simple says anna who asked the bbc not to use her real name but it causes so much falling out it s ridiculous the 29 year old says her cousin chose to hold her hen party in spain at a cost of about 300 per person for flights and accommodation before factoring in spending money anna says she told her cousin she couldn t afford it but was then hit with passive aggressive messages she said just save 20 a month for the next year anna says but i didn t have that then she said ask your dad begrudgingly anna agreed to go but the hen was then cancelled due to covid she s since been invited to a number of other hen parties and weddings she feels she can t justify the costs but doesn t want to be labelled as the friend who can t afford it i could imagine the comments behind my back anna says then there are the costs when you actually get to said hen stag or wedding my best friend claire got married recently and as a lifelong raver had decided to hold her hen party in ibiza as her bridesmaids we tried to keep costs down hotels were prohibitively expensive so we opted for a hostel instead it looked decent online but turned out to be not dissimilar to a prison cell with flights accommodation and spending in bars and clubs the whole trip set us back about 1 000 each still according to research we did comparatively well according to a study from aviva in 2023 stag and hen invitees spent an average of 779 per person in the uk and 1 208 abroad the average price abroad was 1 664 this year according to a separate study by the insurer for jasmine who s 28 it s the unexpected costs that are the worst she s been to hen parties where there s been a set price but then additional payments of up to 100 per person were asked for and you ve already committed and you don t want to pull out she says jasmine who s engaged to be married thinks an appropriate amount to spend should be in the region of 100 200 as you d spend that on a day or night out anyway then there s the thorny question of splitting bills another woman who we re calling jemima says on a recent hen weekend she had to contribute to a central kitty for bars even though she doesn t drink it made no sense but you have to go along with the flow the 34 year old says the bills kept racking up and up this is not just a british problem either tiktok creator sydney jo from new york recently told me as she and her friends approach their 30s bachelorettes and weddings have become a major source of drama and that s provided excellent content for her viral series about a girls group chat in a recent episode set during a bachelorette trip to costa rica one of the characters declares that her friend is driving her insane the money stuff her friend guesses yes thank you the 27 year old replies it s like refusing to order ubers being so annoying about the cheque at every single meal seriously i m going to lose it once you re done with the hen and stag do then you have to factor in the cost of going to the big day itself lucy went to a friend s wedding in switzerland last year which she says cost her about 700 it was in a really random town she says which involved taking a train and a bus and accommodation options were very limited which meant she had to stay in an expensive hotel driving up costs food was covered but everyone had to pay for their own drinks it was a lovely day lucy says but very expensive the couple are now getting divorced so that was a waste of money she adds elle got married in cyprus when she was in her early 30s she s also now divorced and says on reflection it wasn t worth it family and friends had flown out and in the lead up to the wedding activities like paragliding and boat days had been booked so the costs had really added up looking back i wouldn t have done a destination wedding i know how much pressure it put people under elle says one of my bridesmaids was upset as she couldn t afford it and for a while she was too scared to tell me eventually she did and i felt really bad so how to navigate this minefield personal finance expert laura suter has the following advice lucy who s getting married herself next year says previous experience has made her conscious of costs for her guests charles who s also planning his wedding agrees many of my mates already have multiple weddings booked in for next year and i want to make sure everyone can come to mine he says speaking to my best man we might do my stag when the world cup is on so we don t have to plan activities everyone will just go to the pub and watch the football that will definitely save on costs

ripped shredded jacked swole which are you gym jargon such as this which refers to the size and definition of muscles has long been heard exchanged between pumped men in gym locker rooms and now among teenagers too tiktok videos show boys as young as 13 and 14 in school toilets flexing veiny biceps which bulge out of their school uniforms the quest for brick like abs has become serious business even if you re still only in year 8 with posts on socials with hashtags like shreddedphysique being viewed more than four billion times the desire to get this look for many might mean doing a few deadlifts and drinking a protein shake from time to time for others it could be working out a few times a week playing sport and eating a lot of chicken but for a growing few it means going to the gym most nights often following intense training regimes from social media and learning how to cut and bulk the cut and bulk cycle consists of eating hundreds of calories more than your recommended daily intake to get bigger retaining some fat in the process then several weeks later cutting calorie intake down to lose the fat for a leaner more defined look it can be all consuming and involves a lot of calorie counting working out and dedication some sports nutritionists say it can be harmful affecting hormone health growth and development and could potentially lead to problems with eating disorders such as muscle dysmorphia the idea your body is smaller and less muscly than it actually is i ve spoken to three teenagers who all share a love of the gym about what is driving them to get ripped this way when george holland first walked on stage he thought he might feel nervous the 14 year old was by far the youngest contestant in the under 19s category of the national amateur body builders association finals wearing fake tan and a pair of small trunks it might have felt a bit exposing to start flexing his muscles before an audience of hundreds but george says i had practiced everything and i knew there was nothing to be worried about he went on to win the bronze medal george joined a gym when he was 11 having watched some of the bodybuilding greats online who inspired him to give it a go in the early days he explains he would work on each muscle group twice a week lifting no more than 10kg the heaviest permitted for a child under 16 at his local leisure centre but after changing gyms for a proper gym vibe he says he could start to increase the load working out alongside 20 30 year olds after seeking out more experienced men from whom to learn george is now coached by a former mr universe eddie ellwood he s bench pressing 140kg squatting 180kg and deadlifting 200kg his drive he says comes from looking at others in the gym and wanting to be as big as them george eats six meals a day goes to school trains hard four days on one day off four days on and posts to his 140 000 followers on tiktok and instagram he s currently in a bulking stage he explains consuming around 4 100 calories a day after 16 weeks he will start to cut gradually reducing his calorie intake to 2 200 a day when i ask if he s worried about the intensity of his fitness regime and the desire to look big at such a young age he s very clear i completely disagree with that going to the gym when you are young is dead good for you it s good for your mental health your overall fitness and it gives you good discipline george hazard was 12 when he started working out that was during lockdown and his home gym consisted of a pull up bar a few weights and a plastic bench in his garage now 17 he says going to the gym has become a bit of an addiction he s there five or six nights a week and along with his mates he bulks out and cuts back george feels it s helped him stay mobile since recovering from a leg lengthening operation where a nail was put through his femur bone after he was born with one leg shorter than the other he says you can get fountains of knowledge from social media especially around optimal muscle growth but how do you distinguish between well tested science based recommendations and other less informed suggestions i ask him once you ve spent a good few hours on tiktok for example you get a feeling for what is a load of rubbish and what is good stuff george replies for a start the decent ones put links to studies alongside their content he says you can workout and eat well but it can be difficult being so young because you can t stick to a strict diet and tell your parents exactly what they have to make for tea george does eat lot of chicken has several eggs for breakfast and says his grandma is very good at giving him a high protein diet there is a movement of young people who are interested in health fitness and working out he says and he feels that s no bad thing you work hard and see the results george says you can t really cheat getting bigger seeing his uncle powerlifting spurred nat walney into working out aged 12 and he s loved the gym since day one between the ages of 13 and 16 he tried dirty bulking a process of eating huge amounts of food to get big the more he worked out the bigger he grew but it became unsustainable nat who is now 18 says he was eating 80 junk 20 nutritious food and while he might have looked jacked on the outside on the inside his gut was a mess i had really bad acne and i felt really self conscious he tried cutting out fast food and other ultra processed foods then he found the carnivore diet and began to fast the carnivore diet does not come without risks but nat is adamant it works for him the 18 year old shows me the main foods that that he eats raw steak eggs and raw milk it s an ancestral diet nat says which is what we survived off it s primal nat fasts for 20 hours a day to improve his mental clarity he says his family have always been supportive of his choices but even they have found it difficult to adjust to his regime some studies suggest intermittent fasting can have some positive effects as an adult but it can be harmful for teenagers because they still need fuel for growth nat says he had a spiritual awakening after fasting for a week using chatgpt for advice and guidance fasting for more than three days can have an impact on major organs using ai bots to help devise fitness plans is something many do but they should be used with caution the quality of the information they provide is variable and may not have any credible evidence behind it what s his endgame i ask nat surely this kind of lifestyle is difficult to maintain he wants to promote his way of life online to help others he says i ll keep going for as long as i can i have recently read something that does not recommend fasting so if i start to feel bad then i can just change my diet all the experts i ve spoken to agree there s nothing wrong with the desire to be fit and healthy especially from a young age but what does that mean is fit and healthy becoming increasingly wrapped up in a tight torso and sculpted pecs too often it s about the look rather than what healthy really means which comes in all shapes and sizes children s dietician lucy upton explains she says this growing trend is not only pushing some teenagers to extremes the advice online on how to achieve it often lacks credible evidence sometimes content on socials for example can nod to a scientific truth but when examined that truth is in a completely different context says ms upton in the first instance she recommends looking more closely at the person posting the content thinking about whether it s coming from personal experience or a clinical background and whether it applies to your own situation and if someone is trying to sell something they are endorsing then that s a big red flag meanwhile sam grady graham a gb boxing coach says following restrictive eating regimes in your teens is potentially harmful he says the rate of growth between 12 and 18 is exponential so the body needs a full and nutritious diet to fuel it foodwise that s a balanced holistic diet from the main food groups fruit vegetables grains proteins and dairy and not going to extremes when it comes to working out and varying levels of intensity he says don t go too hard too quickly movement over muscle is the way we look at it he says get the movement right when you re lifting you might not see progress immediately but long term you set yourself a strong foundation to build upon
rock band queen were the star guests at the last night of the proms giving their first ever symphonic performance of their rock operetta bohemian rhapsody sir brian may and roger taylor joined the bbc symphony orchestra and the bbc symphony chorus to bring their scaramouches and fandangos to the royal albert hall as the song celebrated its 50th anniversary queen singer freddie mercury who died in 1991 would have loved to be here sir brian told bbc news he d have been on that stage lapping it up asked what the flamboyant star would have worn his bandmate replied i think it would be formal he wouldn t do the short shorts or the leotard he d be in tails very elegant tenor sam oladeinde amply filled mercury s high top sneakers for saturday s performance while the chorus was bolstered by the national youth choir the bbc singers and soprano louise alder for the famous bismillah section sir brian momentarily missed his cue on the closing guitar solo but the climax a ghostly recording of mercury singing any way the wind blows followed by roger taylor striking britain s largest gong was met with a massive roar of approval stuart morley s all new orchestral arrangement gave bohemian rhapsody a fresh grandeur said chorister gareth malone who watched the performance this is a big room to fill and it filled it speaking backstage sir brian called the performance very emotional a little too emotional for me he added i missed a couple of things which i wish would have loved to get better but the overall feeling was great the last night marked the culmination of eight weeks of concerts across the country from bradford and bristol to gateshead and belfast the finale at london s royal albert hall also starred comedian bill bailey who played leroy anderson s 1950 classic the typewriter on well a typewriter a comedic ode to office life it features just two keys of the machine for clarity and to avoid jamming apparently as well as the ding of the carriage return at the end of each phrase known to many as the theme song to bbc radio 4 s the news quiz it was a quirky highlight that bailey dedicated to his late mother i just wish my mum was around for her to see it he said ahead of the show i think that would be just a wonderful moment to see those early times when she inspired me to listen to music and then there i am at the proms bailey was welcomed on stage by audience members who chanted a greeting referencing room 101 although their meaning was not immediately clear the last night was led for the first time by hong kong born conductor elim chan who acknowledged her debut by hanging a learner s plate from her podium but she was a confident charismatic leader who curated the concert around themes of childhood the 38 year old explained that she had been inspired to take up the baton after watching mickey mouse conducting the constellation of stars in walt disney s animated classic fantasia accordingly she included the sorcerer s apprentice which scored that scene as part of saturday s programme little girl elim is not staying in the dressing room she told bbc two before the performance she s coming on the stage with me and i ll give her a little pat on the back british trumpeter alison balsom also looked back to her youth as she gave her retirement performance at the age of 46 she bowed out of her professional career with hummel s trumpet concerto in e flat major which she first heard at the barbican as a young girl it was an emotional performance with balsom producing a beautifully rounded tone during the slower languorous movements before switching into high gear for the dazzling pyrotechnics of the closing rondo it feels like a wonderful finale to be able to play this piece i ve lived with all my musical life she said i can t say how lucky i am to have had music in my life because it s enriched me as a human being as she ended her performance balsom was showered with roses from an appreciative audience alder was the night s star soprano promising an uplifting evening as an antidote to global political turmoil she transported audiences to edwardian london with a cheeky medley of songs from my fair lady and scaled the heights with her rendition of vilja song the nostalgic showpiece of franz leha r s operetta the merry widow i admire any soprano who has a huge voice but can do internalised soft singing like that observed bbc radio 3 s georgia mann that is the mark of true class the singer embraced the last night s party atmosphere adopting a cockney accent and flower sellers costume for wouldn t it be loverly and sporting a spectacular union flag ballgown for rule britannia the concert ended with the traditional programme of sea shanties and patriotic songs like jerusalem and land of hope and glory as the audience waved flags set off party poppers and waved stuffed toys bill bailey reappeared at the end of the concert playing auld lang syne on the royal albert hall s famous voice of jupiter organ but not before bashing out an impromptu version of europe s rock classic the final countdown it gave the season a suitably celebratory and idiosyncratic climax this year s season has totalled 86 concerts featuring everyone from jazz singer samara joy to the world s only one handed pianist nicholas mccarthy highlights included the vienna philharmonic s superlative performance of bruckner s symphony no 9 and star conductor klaus m kel who delivered an astonishingly emotional version of gustav mahler s fifth symphony with the netherlands royal concertgebouw orchestra there was also a prom dedicated to the music of the traitors another featuring the music of psycho composer bernard herrmann and crossover concert with pop star jade thirlwall and guitar virtuoso st vincent almost 290 000 tickets were sold across the season and and millions more tuned into coverage across bbc radio 3 bbc sounds and bbc television the festival will return on 17 july 2026 for its 131st season interval
to the outside world he looked like a hard working father who lived in a modest end of terrace house there was nothing flash about him at all nothing screamed this person is a drug dealer said the covert officer who led the surveillance of robert andrews jr the 34 year old wasn t even on the radar of police until officers found messages from him on the phone of another gang leader in which they joked they would either end up millionaires or sharing a cell as they regularly sorted six figure drug deals detectives quickly realised that behind the everyman image andrews jr was the mastermind of a multi million pound drug empire selling cocaine and heroin on an industrial scale secret police filming soon caught andrews jr doing brazen class a drug deals in broad daylight and handing over more than 100 000 at a time in supermarket carrier bags he seemed like an average guy always wore his work clothes lived in a regular house with his partner and children a covert officer told the bbc s catching a crime boss there was no high value vehicle no designer clothing organised crime detectives were alerted to andrews jr when officers found some revealing whatsapp messages on the phone of another drugs kingpin called kerry evans evans lived 30 miles 48km away in merthyr tydfil and after arresting him investigators found evans had regularly messaged one number in particular to organise drug deals and payments that number belonged to a robert andrews jr from newport evans was sentenced to 14 years and five months in jail last year and andrews jr was soon to follow it doesn t require a mass of information sometimes it s just a little nugget that can start the job off admitted gwent police s det insp ian bartholomew the whatsapp exchanges suggested to police that andrews jr was a high level dealer and detectives were warned that advanced tactics would be needed because he might be difficult to catch surveillance of andrews jr quickly revealed his underground world clandestine officers under operation name mayland followed him to regular liaisons at a secluded woodland patch of land near the busy m4 motorway where several drugs exchanges were caught on camera this was a particular area of interest during the investigation the covert officer recalled we noticed a lot of criminality was taking place in this cleared area this location became known simply as the clearing it was a very dense area she added you d only go there if you knew it or had specific directions so i think it was a real safe place where the organised crime group can conduct their criminality and feel like they weren t in the public eye one exchange resulted in the arrest of taxi driver mohammed yamin whose cab was intercepted by police after he drove from the clearing where he had collected 2kg 4 4lb of high purity cocaine from andrews jr it had a street value of around 200 000 and resulted in yamin getting a six and a half year prison sentence for possession with intent to supply surveillance showed how andrews jr used tokens to make sure his money got to his supplier in one exchange he was seen taking a 5 bank note from a man who got into his car and then checking it he did not know the man but knew there was a cash runner arriving from london to collect the money he owed his supplier the unique serial number on the bank note was the authentication he needed to ensure he was handing the cash over to the right person the cash runner s bag was later seized and found to contain 109 000 the investigation found evidence on andrews jr s phone that he had made regular payments of similar amounts to his supplier illustrating the scale of his operation in two weeks alone he had made six payments to his suppliers totalling 650 000 covert officers were confident they were watching an organised crime group in action and raided andrews jr s house in the early hours of the morning just before christmas in 2023 in a final attempt to cover his tracks andrews jr threw his mobile phone on top of a bedroom wardrobe just before police burst into the room to arrest him as he was being handcuffed and the covert officer set out the reasons for his arrest he laughed and seemed quite unfazed the officer said his mobile phone was recovered and proved crucial to the investigation as it contained detailed logs of who had ordered what how much was owed to him and the amount he owed his suppliers robert andrews wasn t somebody who was dealing on a street corner or to his friends said det ch supt andrew tuck he was dealing in large quantities kilo amounts of controlled drugs which would equate to cocaine the size of a bag of sugar at a time police considered andrews jr the principal member of an organised crime group supplying cocaine and heroin across south wales when you look at the quantities of cash involved we re talking tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds per exchange for up to four or five kilos of cocaine at a time added det ch supt tuck while andrews jr did not show signs of his illicit wealth through flash cars or expensive designer clothes police thought he was funnelling his drug cash into building a new home on secluded land when officers raided the unfinished property they found a 60 000 kitchen and lavish furnishings which suggested a level of wealth that the covert officer who arrested him said an average working person wouldn t have been able to afford andrews jr admitted to two charges one of conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin and the second to actually supplying those drugs at the start of 2024 but due to a number of linked cases it took almost two years for him to be sentenced earlier this month andrews jr was sentenced to 14 years and eight months by a judge at newport crown court half of which will be served in prison and the other half on licence samuel takahashi described by police as a significant member of andrews jr s organised crime group was sentenced to eight years the 34 year old from newport had also had been caught on police cameras during the nine months of surveillance exchanging drugs with andrews jr sometimes at the clearing judge carl harrison told andrews jr at his sentencing that dealing drugs fuels misery and that he should be ashamed of involving his own mother in his criminal enterprise at a trial earlier this year she had been given a suspended sentence for paying one of her son s couriers after tracking andrews jr police identified one of his suppliers from the north west of england nathan jones from bolton in greater manchester was given an 18 year sentence after the 32 year old was found selling more than 1m worth of cocaine to andrews jr s gang jones had paid rahail mehrban who is also from bolton 2 000 to courier half a million pounds worth of cocaine from manchester to newport the 32 year old was sentenced to 10 years and nine months i hope this sends a strong message to anybody that drug crime has no place in our communities and there will be consequences added det ch supt tuck

the trucks keep rolling on highway 99 in california the route bustling with freight traffic through the central valley and behind the wheel is often a turbaned sikh man their cabs adorned with religious symbols portraits of sikh gurus or posters of punjabi singers sikhs a religious minority group from india have become a large part of america s trucking industry helping to deliver everything from california strawberries to lumber across the country but a crash in florida and its aftermath have sent shivers through the sikh trucking community that could have economic consequences there are approximately 750 000 sikhs in america and about 150 000 working in the trucking industry mostly as drivers the role they play in this essential industry is evident from the names on their trucks doors singh trucking punjab trucking to the curry served at rest stops along the west coast where approximately 40 of all truck drivers are sikh according to the north american punjabi trucking association many have limited english skills but years of driving experience this has put some drivers in a precarious position as the trump administration has moved to tighten language requirements for commercial drivers in response many sikh temples are offering language classes to help drivers pass their language tests many drivers stayed home out of fear of the new laws we started the class in mid july to help them return to work said tejpaul singh bainiwal who volunteers with a sikh temple in stockton california at an english class at the temple on sunday several drivers practised introductions and reviewed highway signs and regulatory signs many drivers felt shy about speaking but were motivated narinder singh a 51 year old driver who has been working in

cases even local law enforcement has been unresponsive he says while he supports trump s calls for more regulation of commercial licenses and english proficiency requirements raman is concerned that harassment and increasingly strict immigration laws will make it harder for sikhs to work in the industry the trucking industry will soon face a serious driver shortage he said it s a concern shared

sikh truckers or throw water bottles at truck stops they re being ridiculed and harassed they re being called by racial slurs like diaper head and towel head referring to their turbans gurpratap says he worries about his driver s security the harassment impacts gurpratap s business directly sikh drivers in my company are scared to go to florida alabama and arkansas because of immigration and customs raids after the florida crash gurpratap said adding that immigrant drivers were once hailed as warriors during the pandemic when supply backlogs made the value of the industry evident arjun sethi a law professor at george washington university said that the social media accounts in the united states and india as well as some politicians have used this tragedy to target the entire sikh community this episode should be treated as a singular tragic event and not be weaponized to target the entire sikh community arjun said he also worries that rhetoric may lead to violence we have seen for years how inflammatory rhetoric can lead to violence against those same communities sikhs have already faced this in the 2012 wisconsin sikh temple mass shooting in which six sikhs were killed arjun added the federal bureau of investigation s 2024 annual hate crime statistics show sikhs remain the third most targeted religious group behind the jewish and muslim communities following the crash special us envoy richard grenell met with a group of sikh representatives in sacramento and took to social media to decry verbal attacks against sikhs as un american behavior raman singh dhillon chief executive officer of north american punjabi trucking association says that there should be a proper investigation into how states are issuing commercial driver s licenses to individuals who don t meet english proficiency standards but so far teaching english to drivers has largely been left up to members of the sikh community themselves such as the language classes being offered at temples across california no one is interested in addressing the core problem raman says that s why i believe driving schools and state agencies must be regulated harinder singh a senior fellow at the us based sikh research institute agrees he says english proficiency as essential for acclimation and recommends that federal and state governments as well as trucker associations offer subsidized programs to help immigrants learn english as a second language arshveer singh sandhu has been teaching english to the drivers at guru nanak parkash for seven weeks as a volunteer his course english4truckers covers basic english communicating with officers during inspections ordering at restaurants like starbucks or subway calling 911 and explaining issues to mechanics the classes show

spontaneous spending is likely to rise if the limit on contactless cards is increased or scrapped entirely academics say at present the need to press a four digit pin for purchases over 100 gives people a timely prompt about how much they are paying lowering the risk of debt fuelled purchases earlier this week the uk s financial regulator proposed that banks and card providers set their own limits or are allowed to remove them entirely that would make entering a pin even more of a rarity banks and some bbc readers say consumers should be able to set their own contactless limits as debate on the issue picks up ahead of a final decision later in the year contactless payments have become part of everyday life for millions of people across the world when they were introduced in the uk in 2007 the transaction limit was set at 10 increases in the threshold since then included relatively big jumps around the time of the pandemic to 45 in 2020 then to 100 in october 2021 they prompted surges in the average contactless spend clearly the average would rise because more higher value purchases could be made via contactless without a pin but what is much harder to quantify is whether people were spending more frequently and larger amounts than would have been the case if they had needed to enter a pin richard whittle an economist at salford business school says the extra convenience for consumers can come at a cost if this ease of payment leads to consumers spending without thinking they may be more likely to buy what they don t really want or need he says he says this could be a particular issue with credit cards when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt he believes regulators should consider whether to have different rules for contactless credit cards than for contactless debit cards stuart mills a lecturer in economics at the university of leeds says cash gives visible and immediate feedback on how much money you have while a pin is an important friction point for controlling spending removing such frictions while offering some convenience benefits is also likely to see many more people realising they ve spent an awful lot more than they ever planned to he says both these academics have raised this concern before but this is not solely a theoretical argument in the kent market town of sevenoaks shopper robert ryan told the bbc that entering a pin does give me a bit of a prompt to make sure i m not overspending on my tap and go however the reality for many people is that under pressure from the cost of living they are rarely spending more than 100 in one go anyway so contactless has become the norm research by barclays suggests nearly 95 of all eligible in store card transactions were contactless in 2024 terezai takacs who works in a florists in sevenoaks says that over the last couple of years people were cutting back on spending such as asking for smaller bouquets ms takacs also points out that the majority of customers now pay via the digital wallet on their smartphone paying this way already has an unlimited payment limit owing to the in built extra security features such as thumbprints or face id dr whittle says that is likely to dilute the impact of raising the contactless card limit on spontaneous or reckless spending because young people in particular are paying by phone some say scrapping the contactless card limit is overdue because it is far less relevant when people are accustomed to pin free spending on a phone regulators are finally catching up with how people actually pay says hannah fitzsimons chief executive at fintech company cashflow digital wallets on smartphones face no limits so why should cards be stuck in the past if the contactless card limit were to increase or be scrapped then it would push the uk further on than much of europe and more in line with rules in other advanced economies in canada the industry sets the level rather than regulators and it is set by providers in the us and singapore a model which the financial conduct authority fca wants to replicate in the uk banks agree with the regulator although uk finance the industry trade body says any changes will be made thoughtfully with security at the core banks and card providers that do change limits will be encouraged to allow customers to set their own thresholds or turn off contactless entirely on their cards gabby collins payments director at lloyds banking group the uk s biggest bank says lloyds halifax and bank of scotland customers can already set their own contactless payment limits in our apps in 5 steps up to 100 and we re absolutely committed to keeping that flexibility that option has support among some bbc readers viewers and listeners who contacted us on this topic through your voice your bbc news ben aged 36 from london told us the most important principle here is personal choice i would like to set my own personal limit it is my card and my choice based on convenience and risk tolerance some banks do not allow for this this option has to be provided to everyone others have concerns over security saying that unlimited contactless cards would become more of a temptation to thieves and fraudsters charities warn that not everyone has the digital skills to set their own limits in other circumstances it can have an extremely serious impact on people s lives sam smethers chief executive of surviving economic abuse says unlimited contactless cards give controlling partners the opportunity for limitless economic abuse unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor s bank account with no checks or alerts she says this could leave a survivor without the money they need to flee and reach safety while pushing them even further into debt she warns that it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society cash is a lifeline to many survivors because it was the only way to escape abusers who can monitor online transactions withhold bank cards and close down bank accounts she says additional reporting by andree massiah
the start of the school year saw the education secretary bridget phillipson warn parents about the need for children to attend classes data suggests half of pupils who missed lessons in the first week of term last year went on to become persistently absent but school leaders say they are seeing more children who find attending school too traumatic what is it like having a child with what psychologists call emotionally based school avoidance and what should be done to help the final time julie took her daughter to school in july 2023 a member of staff congratulated her rosie who was then eight was wearing a dirty pyjama top a pair of jogging bottoms a pair of trainers with no socks she had her headphones on she was holding a teddy julie recalls i walked into school and the special needs co ordinator then said to me well done you got her here but for julie 48 it was not a win she couldn t even speak she hadn t eaten she had maybe three or four hours sleep but i d done a good job as a parent for making her go to school at the time rosie who has autism was in year three at a primary school in northamptonshire julie says her daughter had struggled with the school environment since her time in nursery and is now educated out of school rosie she recalls was in fight and flight the whole time she was in the classroom which just overwhelmed her eventually rosie was begging not to leave the house for school and was self harming sometimes on the school run she would have night terrors she would be up screaming if she went to sleep at all it just felt as if i was walking her into the lion s den every single day she says meanwhile julie and her husband james received letters and home visits from school staff about rosie s attendance it was very lonely all of a sudden there s these letters and people are talking about fines and i was lost on that final say julie says she dragged rosie to school because that was the expectation now she wishes she had taken rosie out of school earlier but i also feel that if i hadn t have got to the point where she broke i would never have known if it had worked she says based on rosie s reaction to school an educational psychologist who assessed her noted she had emotionally based school avoidance or ebsa a condition school leaders say they are encountering more anna hewes the head teacher of prince william school a 1 400 pupil secondary in oundle northamptonshire says schools are seeing a big increase in ebsa among pupils in year seven eight and nine the transition to secondary school is she adds a key time and at the start of the school year ebsa is at the forefront of our minds because of the new year sevens coming through the noises the bustling nature of a school the busyness all the classes walking around make it a real challenge for those with sensory needs she says but more generally it s very tough to be a teenager these days smartphones and social media she adds mean young people can t escape anymore it definitely is a post covid spike and these young people are genuinely really struggling to step over the threshold of the school and sometimes leave their bedrooms across england rates of persistent absence when pupils miss 10 or more of lessons have remained high since the pandemic last academic year almost 19 of pupils were persistently absent compared with 11 in 2018 19 mrs hewes says ebsa is a significant part of the issue a lack of reliable data however means it is difficult to know how big a part mrs hewes says prince william academy prioritises inclusion and has recruited an assistant head teacher for belonging it has also opened a specialist school within a school for pupils with ebsa funded by north northamptonshire council four students have been enrolled so far and by 2028 it expects to see 48 jenny nimmo the head of inclusion at east midlands academy trust which runs prince william academy says the unit will have more homely classrooms and on site mental health provision she hopes it will be future proof because ebsa isn t going away there are she adds more and more young people with emotionally based school avoidance and indeed anxiety the compass centre in luton also help pupils with ebsa access education dr joanne summers luton borough council s principal educational psychologist says the condition can appear suddenly but when you look back there has been anxiety around being in school and one incident might be a catalyst intervening early she adds is important as falling behind on school work and losing contact with friends can make anxiety worse dr summers says luton has been trying to move away from seeing school absences as defiance and truancy we are being curious about what s going on for that young person why is it that they are behaving in this way she adds geoff barton a former head teacher in suffolk and previous general secretary of the association of school and college leaders says there should be more emphasis on the humanity of our schools rather than draconian discipline over absences he is researching special educational needs send provision for the left leaning think tank the institute for public policy research he says the people he is speaking to are universally saying that anxiety among pupils has increased but the age of anxiety is only one reason for persistent absence another is poverty while he says there is also a long shadow in education of covid when schools started to feel a bit more of an optional decision cornelia andrecut the executive director of children s services for north northamptonshire council said the authority has offered training courses for schools to learn strategies to support children with ebsa the government says it will spend 740m creating more specialist places in mainstream schools and placing send leads in 1 000 new family hubs a department for education spokesperson says schools should take a support first approach for children who are facing barriers to regular school attendance and we are expanding access to mental health support teams in all schools ensuring that every pupil has access to early support services in their community for julie taking rosie out of school was not a lifestyle choice but was prompted by trauma and distress that her daughter is still recovering from does she regret pushing rosie to attend school yeah definitely i always wonder if there was a bit of trust broken between us as mum and daughter when i still took her into that place when it was that bad follow northamptonshire news

no team has won the premier league title after losing two of their opening three games during a 38 match season manchester city head into sunday s crunch derby trailing rivals manchester united by a point at the start of an important week for pep guardiola s men city last went into a manchester derby behind united in the table in december 2020 when they were eighth and the old trafford club one place above united manager ruben amorim s issues have been laid bare in public following a humiliating carabao cup exit at the hands of league two side grimsby and red devils legend wayne rooney stating something is broken at the club but united have some momentum as they go into the game on the back of a last gasp victory against burnley before the international break while city have suffered back to back defeats guardiola s side find themselves in a difficult moment even at this early juncture in the season and the spaniard has issues to fix to prevent any concerns turning into a full crisis asked whether the game is bigger for city or united guardiola told bbc sport i am thinking about ourselves we always have respect for our city rivals we came back on thursday players came back good and i am looking forward to it for our fans i know how important it is it is a really important game for us to change the dynamic and i trust the players a lot we are going to do a good game last term was a particularly disappointing one for guardiola and his side failing to lift a major trophy for the first time in eight years one season without silverware is poor enough for the spaniard and though it is still early days ending 2025 26 without triumphing would be unthinkable guardiola needed to refresh a playing squad that often lacked energy last season and did so in his usual ruthless manner out went serial winners with huge personalities in kevin de bruyne kyle walker jack grealish ilkay gundogan ederson and manuel akanji while scott carson made an exit too he was highly valued for his presence around the squad as a mentor to the younger players the dressing room has lost a significant amount of experience which has been built over a number of years and cannot simply be replaced overnight guardiola has turned to the exuberance of youth in an attempt to wrestle the title back from liverpool who look to be heavy favourites to retain their crown following heavy investment in the summer while city have added 10 new players to the squad since january with a total expenditure of about 350m it is dwarfed by the reds strengthening their squad to the tune of a record 415m this summer but city go into another campaign without a recognised right back with rico lewis struggling somewhat in the home loss against tottenham while matheus nunes came in against brighton and conceded a penalty in the defeat guardiola pointed to an extensive injury list for last season s travails and they are stacking up once more as new signing rayan cherki has been ruled out for two months with a thigh injury missing out on the revenge he vowed to take against united omar marmoush rayan ait nouri and mateo kovacic are also sidelined john stones is a doubt and josko gvardiol and savinho are yet to make an appearance this season club insiders have told bbc sport that training has gone well and there is confidence heading into sunday s fixture after a disappointing result at home to spurs and failing to get anything out of the game at brighton despite playing well but there was also an acknowledgement that this is a big week for city they host their rivals before the emotional return of de bruyne with napoli in the champions league on thursday followed by a trip to fellow title contenders arsenal next sunday there has been real confusion around the goalkeeping situation at city this summer too speaking in june guardiola said the two keepers they have ederson and stefan ortega will continue with both going on to play at the club world cup in the usa having not seemingly been in the market for a new keeper city then ended up signing three marcus bettinelli was brought in to cover the departure of carson while city had matching rights on newcastle s 27m bid for burnley s james trafford and the club felt the prospect of re signing the englishman was too good to turn down ederson meanwhile went from being declared guardiola s number one external before the opening premier league game against wolves to being shipped off to fenerbahce a mere 18 days later in came gianluigi donnarumma from paris st germain on deadline day after the italy number one was brutally axed by luis enrique despite helping the club to the treble last season despite being deemed surplus to requirements ortega remains at the etihad too having turned down options to leave meaning guardiola has four first team keepers on the books a lot of people didn t really understand the true value of ederson because his shot stopping is great but his ability to get on the ball and to be the spare player that can create something former city defender nedum onuoha told bbc s football focus now he s gone the people who are trying to fill those boots won t be able to do it in the same way from a city perspective if their goalkeeper continues to get pressed and make those sorts of errors it will encourage the opposition and change how city play it is hard to envisage donnarumma being signed to sit on the bench which leaves trafford in a situation where he thought he was coming in as the long term heir to ederson but instead playing second fiddle to the towering italian despite being only 26 donnarumma brings vast experience as an elite match winning keeper with incredible shot stopping ability and he now has the opportunity to showcase his talents in england he is so tall he is so huge guardiola said from all the keepers we want safe balls give confidence to the team have personality and a big presence in the biggest stages in the champions league last season at villa park anfield and in many games he proved how good he is with united also experiencing difficulties in between the sticks they signed belgian sanne lammens on deadline day but amorim confirmed altay bayindir will start in goal on sunday we need a big presence guardiola on keeper dilemma city have been surprisingly poor and despite united s own frailties this season amorim s men may target two specific weaknesses amorim s game model as analysed earlier this season centres around aiming to entice pressure before launching direct passes often for team mates running in behind secondly their system focuses on playing down the flanks rather than centrally often aiming to overload the wide areas two of city s biggest weaknesses have come in both of these areas against spurs and brighton city conceded from situations in which they failed to press the opposition s wide defender this player then played a direct pass down the flank where both spurs and brighton had positioned extra players after losing the duel the opposition were able to attack city s disorganised backline before scoring united s tendency to go long overloading the wide areas may therefore pose a challenge city will need to be aware of particularly if they can find a player with the hold up quality of bryan mbeumo i don t think this is a city we re used to seeing we started to say that last season and we thought a lot of that was because of the absence of rodri former england midfielder fara williams told football focus but i feel like they still have the same habits defensively in terms of the mistakes they were making and conceding goals in the same manner they were last year city have also struggled to win duels in the middle of the pitch when games have become stretched a hallmark of matches united have played so far united s bruno fernandes casemiro and mason mount have won 55 61 and 65 of their respective duels this season city s midfield cohort have standouts in nico gonzalez 73 and rodri 71 but generally have struggled otherwise with bernardo silva 26 rayan cherki 38 and tijjani reijnders 44 bringing the average down they re caught in two stalls at the minute they want to be aggressive but if you re a bit late it doesn t work onuoha added guardiola s midfield selection and their ability to win duels against a direct united will be a key factor in this weekend s derby spurs overloaded the wide areas played direct passes and won their respective duels before scoring against man city

a new butterfly species has been recorded in the uk for the first time following the hot weather over the summer prof russell wynn director of wild new forest said the little arboreal ladybird s had been found in moth traps across the new forest but there were no confirmed british records prior to this influx they normally live in france and continental europe but have made the trip across the english channel to settle in southampton and the new forest prof wynn said he added that the uk species inventory will now recognise them as new to britain prof wynn who also chairs the new forest biodiversity forum said the hot weather this year meant it had been tough for some of the wetland animals but it s been a good year for many of the insects ladybirds included he said this was one of many species of winged insect that had colonised southern england because of warming temperatures there s lots of evidence of moths and butterflies moving north and gradually colonising prof wynn said the new forest is home to ancient woodland fens heaths and bogs making it a diverse habitat the quality of the habitat in the new forest and the work we re doing to expand and restore those habitats make us a good landing point for species that are hopping across the channel and looking for a decent habitat to colonise prof wynn said the wild new forest is one of the teams involved in the species survival fund ssf which has seen groups working across about 24 sites in the national park working on nature reservation prof wynn said after doing an ecological survey in one site he found 13 spot ladybird species in the area for first time in 20 years it s nationally pretty scarce and good to record it back in the new forest and good to record it in a site where we re going to be doing some wetland creation work to expand the area of wetland habitat so the future of the species at that site is looking good as they ll be a nice little pond complex there next year he said as well as this the hippodamia variegata known as the adonis ladybird have been seen in drier parts of the forest we are in a period of flux with our biodiversity because of climate change and so if we can provide a home for species that are naturally colonising and moving north then i think that s a positive thing because they re going to be the species that are going to thrive in the coming decades as temperatures continue to increase prof wynn said he wants to encourage people to embrace the new species and take more time in the forest paying attention to the estimated 20 000 species of animal plants and fungi in the area if you do you ll be rewarded with some of these little gems he said the ones that are arriving now are probably going to be the species that are dominant in the coming decades and centuries so we should certainly welcome them because they re going to be what s maintaining our biodiversity and making sure that we ve still got wildlife to look at in 100 years you can follow bbc hampshire isle of wight on facebook x twitter or instagram

on the night in april 1968 that the rev dr martin luther king jr was assassinated senator robert f kennedy then a candidate for president told a shocked and largely black crowd in indianapolis that it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in those of you who are black he said could be filled with a desire for revenge or he said the nation could try to replace violence with an effort to understand it was considered one of the finest speeches of his life but in the wake of dr king s death riots looting and arson erupted in more than 100 american cities and kennedy himself was assassinated that june in california fifty seven years later the nation is at another polarized moment after the assassination of charlie kirk the 31 year old conservative activist gunned down on a college campus in utah beyond an ability to inspire passion in others dr king and mr kirk had almost nothing in common but their murders both occurred in a country already awash in violent political rhetoric and partisan anger americans are now grappling with the brutal killing of a young leader who is viewed through radically different lenses on the right mr kirk has been lionized as an inspiration to a new generation of republicans on the left he has been pilloried as a divider who attacked civil rights transgender rights feminism and islam as people wrestle over mr kirk s legacy historians and scholars say the lessons of this particular time will depend on americans themselves it is another test they say of the american experiment does a reprehensible crime against a political figure lead to more reprehensible acts or does it remind us that we have to be able to live with people whose opinions we despise without resorting to violence asked the presidential biographer jon meacham if this is open season on everybody who expresses an opinion then the american covenant is broken in the immediate aftermath of mr kirk s murder anger has pulsed loudly president trump blamed the left for what he said was savage rhetoric that had led to mr kirk s death and vowed to go after those who contributed to this atrocity democrats and republicans in congress lashed out at each other and are ever more fearful for their own safety people who castigated mr kirk and his views have been targeted and exposed by right wing influencers mentions of the term civil war skyrocketed on social media platforms gov spencer cox of utah a republican has stood out for trying to turn down the heat this is certainly about the tragic death assassination political assassination of charlie kirk he said at a news conference on friday but it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual it is an attack on all of us mr kirk he said championed free speech and in having his life taken in that very act makes it more difficult for people to feel like they can share their ideas that they can speak freely mr kirk did speak freely he called dr king awful and not a good person he described the civil rights act as a huge mistake and george floyd as a scumbag he said that islam is not compatible with western civilization and accused jewish donors of fueling radicalism by financing not just colleges it s the nonprofits it s the movies it s hollywood it s all of it democratic women he said want to die alone without children but among thousands of young conservatives on american college campuses he was a rock star a gifted speaker who relished debating with more liberal students at the 2024 republican convention he reached out directly to his generation democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations while gen z has to pinch pennies just so that they can never own a home never marry and work until they die childless he said to brad parscale mr trump s first campaign manager in 2020 mr kirk loved america and was truly remarkable mr parscale recalled that mr kirk the founder of turning point usa the nation s pre eminent right wing youth activist group had come to him in 2018 to offer his help for the campaign but i told him go do your own thing and you ll help the president 100 times more the campaign will hold you back you re bigger than this and he was mr parscale said to dan t carter the author of the politics of rage george wallace the origins of the new conservatism and the transformation of american politics mr kirk was a dark force his assassination he said is a terrible thing for america but i don t think we gain anything by embracing him as some kind of open minded individual who strengthened democracy bishop mariann edgar budde of the episcopal diocese of washington who angered mr trump when she asked him the day after his second inauguration to have mercy on immigrants and l g b t q people said rage from those anguished over mr kirk s death was to be expected public grief is necessary and this is a time for those who loved and admired charlie kirk to grieve and to grieve publicly she said for those who were hurt or aggrieved by his positions i think this is a time for us to be gracious and allow grief to be expressed and at the same time not to be surprised that other emotions are also communicated when someone dies she said we try to focus on the good to the point that some people say i don t recognize the man who is being eulogized but i hear that from a son speaking about his father i ve been in those rooms if that happens in family life why would we be surprised if it happens in our national life with a public figure can t we be gracious about that too dannagal goldthwaite young a professor of communications at the university of delaware who researches media psychology and public opinion said she had noticed a restraint in mainstream media reporting about mr kirk s death i think there is a recognition that this moment is so important and this country is such a tinderbox that people who are in media and journalism especially those on the left are aware that they have a responsibility to take the temperature down and i think that s a very good thing in terms of democratic health but she said she thought some things had gotten lost notably that people who praised mr kirk for civility were confusing the term with politeness charlie kirk was polite which is about your mode of discourse she said in her opinion he was not civil because she said he excluded certain groups from the public sphere despite the vitriol of the moment professor young said she was an optimist thanks in part to what she has learned from public opinion research i know what people really want americans are sickened by these moments by and large americans reject political violence on friday after announcing the arrest of the man suspected of killing mr kirk mr cox made an appeal to young people some of them loved the young activist he said and some of them hated him for his part mr kirk would say always forgive your enemies nothing annoys them so much the governor recalled to my young friends out there you are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage mr cox said it feels like rage is the only option but through those words we have a reminder that we can choose a different path your generation he added has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we are suffering through

the day after charlie kirk was killed an acquaintance of tyler robinson s posed a question to him in a group chat the f b i had just released two grainy surveillance images of a skinny young man in a cap and sunglasses walking in a stairwell on the utah valley university campus and had asked for the public s help in identifying the suspect tagging mr robinson s username on discord a messaging platform the acquaintance attached the images and wrote wya where you at with a skull emoji suggesting that mr robinson 22 looked like the man being sought mr robinson replied within a minute his doppelganger he wrote was trying to get me in trouble tyler killed charlie another user wrote apparently in jest that was on thursday afternoon around 1 p m local time it was not until later that night nearly 34 hours after the shooting that mr robinson was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the assassination of mr kirk 31 a conservative pundit whose killing has inflamed the political world the discord messages were the clearest glimpse yet of the suspect s demeanor in the hours after the killing they were shared with the new york times by someone who knew mr robinson in high school and has kept up with him in the group chat which includes about 20 people but said he had not seen mr robinson in person for several years he spoke on the condition that his name not be used fearing harassment for being an acquaintance of the suspect the times independently verified that the person who shared the screenshots attended high school with mr robinson and found other indications that they knew one another the screenshots were shared at the request of the times discord declined to confirm mr robinson s username but it matches several other accounts that he used elsewhere online the suspect is expected to be formally charged by local prosecutors on tuesday it was not clear on saturday if he had a lawyer the messages do not shed light on a possible motivation for the shooting which has been fiercely debated by people trying to ascribe blame to a political side a police officer wrote in an affidavit that mr robinson had recently discussed mr kirk s upcoming event in utah with a family member and that the two had talked about why they didn t like him people who knew mr robinson over the years said that he was extremely intelligent followed current events and spent much of his time online or playing video games he was registered to vote but was not affiliated with a political party and appeared to have never voted in an election his parents are both registered republicans after mr robinson joked that the gunman was his look alike another user suggested that the group could turn mr robinson in and get the 100 000 reward that the f b i was offering only if i get a cut mr robinson responded someone posted whatever you do don t go to a mcdonalds anytime soon a reference to the arrest of luigi mangione who was found at a mcdonald s restaurant and charged with the killing of a health insurance chief executive in manhattan mr robinson agreed and offered a supposed joke of his own writing better also get rid of this manifesto and exact copy rifle i have lying around when another user suggested that the killing of mr kirk would lead president trump to send the national guard to utah the suspect replied in a red state nah clearly the shooter was from california around that time several news outlets reported that ammunition found near a rifle at the scene included engravings referencing transgender ideology the truth ultimately was that the engravings included the phrase hey fascist catch as well as lyrics from an antifascist italian folk song and a reference to a sexual meme about a bulge but at the time before the exact phrasing of the engravings was publicly known the suspect sent messages that suggested he was closely following the news i heard the ammo had somethin about trans stuff on it but they aren t releasing photos or exact quotes he wrote he added and also the claim wasn t backed by the official fbi just some dude in the briefing room a few minutes later he joked i m actually charlie kirk wanted to get outta politics so i faked my death now i can live out my dream life in kansas mr robinson s messages on discord appeared next to his avatar which was from a garfield comic and depicted the confused face of garfield s owner jon arbuckle the police have said that the suspect walked onto campus ahead of the event in which mr kirk debated students with opposing beliefs and climbed up to the roof of a building about 400 feet away from where mr kirk was speaking the gunman fired one shot they said fatally striking mr kirk and then dropped down from the roof and rushed off campus the police said that mr robinson had implied or confessed that he committed the crime and that he was then encouraged by a family member and family friend to turn himself in which he did he surrendered to the police in southwestern utah where he lived more than a three hours drive from the campus where the shooting took place following the suspect s arrest on thursday night members of the group chat on discord struggled to believe that he was actually being accused of the crime our governor wants to give him the death penalty dude one wrote another said i truly cannot distinguish if this is for real aric toler

a rosary thrust out the tinted window of a car hands resting on a casket the images of erika kirk in the days since her husband charlie kirk was assassinated have been wrenching though ms kirk has now lurched into a new and harrowing spotlight as she grieves in public for four years she has stood on convention stages alongside mr kirk and built her own following of young conservative admirers while helping her husband build his you have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife ms kirk said standing in a white blazer at a lectern at turning point usa headquarters on friday in her first public speech since her husband a right wing force and key ally to president trump was killed at a college event in utah the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry ms kirk also shared images on instagram where she has more than four million followers of her hands folded together with mr kirk s in his coffin and herself embracing vice president jd vance with his wife usha vance braiding the personal and the political the vulnerable and the operational as she finds herself a widow on a national stage if they thought my husband s mission was big now she wrote you have no idea this is the blueprint that she and mr kirk created together since marrying in 2021 the public image of their marriage deeply appealed to young people in the right wing movement they were building drawing in those who wanted the family life they put on display mr kirk s politics and worldview were inextricably wound together with his personal life and his marriage was a core part of his public reputation and ms kirk 36 a former miss arizona winner and entrepreneur who made biblical streetwear played a critical role in projecting that image she left many political topics to her husband who was known for views that were anti immigrant anti civil rights and anti islam but she also boosted his inflammatory rhetoric on transgender people gay marriage and other issues and made her own condemning statements about the political left the spiritual battle i know you guys feel it it s so deep in the soul you can walk into a room and feel the enemy she told a turning point crowd recently just three months ago at a hotel convention center in dallas mr and ms kirk jointly headlined the young women s leadership summit the largest gathering of young conservative women in the country a turning point usa event when ms kirk took the stage opening night before an audience of 3 000 she emerged in a rose pink dress and a puff of pink smoke audience members applauded and raced to snap videos as ms kirk talked about marriage and motherhood while criticizing left wing perspectives on both before i met charlie i was not on the path of i want to have six kids and a white picket house fence that was not my mind set she told the room but this is how amazing god is when you meet the right man everything shifts when i met charlie that was it i could care less about a career this last point elicited an ecstatic cheer from an audience member when mr kirk joined his wife onstage how great is erika by the way the room burst into more applause college aged women in the audience put their hands over their hearts and broke into a chorus of side conversations about how enviable their marriage seemed i really enjoyed that conversation about marriage and relationships said ella guidry 22 mr kirk told the room that they would answer questions but avoid politics for the night though it was a crowd largely receptive to even his inflammatory comments whether about immigration or race instead they wanted to talk about their relationship and raising children the fun stuff mr kirk said the two discussed making time for date nights despite mr kirk s travel schedule and observing the sabbath every weekend to have time to read the bible together the couple presented a unified message to the room get married early have children you re not wasting a degree when you re raising your children with wisdom love and truth ms kirk advised i don t want you to chase a paycheck mr kirk was the more emphatic foil to his wife the two of them beaming playfully at each another while she softened his messaging young ladies need to be willing to submit to a godly man when you met one mr kirk said the hyper toxic feminism is very off putting to young men for the women who are getting married after 30 that s ok ms kirk said i m trying to bridge the gap here because it is ok it s not ideal it s not probably the best statistical odd position for you but god is good many turning point members had long wanted to emulate the seemingly glamorous model that they saw in watching him and ms kirk i like how they talked about how you can have everything just not at the same time said kieran cunningham 27 who came to the dallas conference from bedford texas to some young women at the turning point usa women s event ms kirk represented contradictions that they see woven broadly into right wing messaging about family and professional life she was a successful entrepreneur but urged her followers to put motherhood before career she was a public face for a movement but advised sublimating ambition to faith and family this emphasis on submission seemed at odds with ms kirk s high profile public reputation to some of her followers as the high school student nicole hadar put it there was a lot of talk from erika about being submissive toward your husband i do want to be married one day but i also want to pursue a career for others it was a comfort that ms kirk didn t seem torn between the two erika does have her own business the turning point attendee ms cunningham noted and after all ms kirk has company in the large and fast growing coterie of conservative women from phyllis schlafly to the wellness influencer alex clark whose careers are spent urging women to be dubious of certain feminist messaging about women s ambitions for public life that ms kirk embraced a public role in her husband s movement is unsurprising given the story of their union mr kirk messaged her on instagram in 2018 wanting to meet they went to dinner at a bill s bar and burger in manhattan and ms kirk thought she might be interviewing for a job at turning point usa fifteen minutes into dinner mr kirk said he pivoted from wanting to hire her to wanting to date her you should absolutely interview for your spouse mr kirk advised at a turning point conference a year ago they got married in 2021 in scottsdale ariz in her speech on friday two days after mr kirk s death ms kirk pledged to take on the mantle of her husband s work she discussed the pain of figuring out what to tell their two children and reflected on the force of their faith and the strength of their marriage all while promising that the turning point usa campus tour would continue and that the group s large december gathering would go forward as planned to everyone listening right now across america the movement my husband built will not die ms kirk said it won t i refuse to let that happen
president trump and his top advisers are escalating their attacks on their opponents in the wake of charlie kirk s killing placing the blame for political violence on democrats alone and signaling a broad crackdown on critics and left leaning institutions mr trump blamed the radical left almost immediately after mr kirk was shot before the authorities had identified a suspect he promised to find those responsible for political violence as well as the organizations that fund it and support it mr trump has an expansive view of those he deems radical applying that term to almost all of his political adversaries in his second term mr trump has pushed the boundaries of his authority to exact retribution on political opponents and institutions the death of mr kirk a popular young conservative activist has added fuel to mr trump s campaign against his opponents he and his administration have promised to bring the killer to justice while using the moment to blame the left and only the left more broadly critics of the administration now worry that mr kirk s murder could be used as a pretext to move even more aggressively against those who speak out against mr trump the authorities were still working to discern a motive in the killing on saturday morning the suspect had recently spoken with a family member about the fact that mr kirk was going to hold an event in utah according to a police affidavit and he and his relative discussed why they didn t like him and the viewpoints he had america in recent years has seen a wave of violence across the political spectrum targeting democrats and republicans but mr trump has focused only on attacks against conservatives and his allies on friday he appeared to excuse right wing radicals by arguing they were motivated by a desire to reduce crime and while the president has provided few specifics about how he plans to address rising political violence or mete out punishments several administration officials vowed to scrutinize speech by those who have denounced mr kirk a self declared supporter of free speech and his often inflammatory views defense secretary pete hegseth said that his agency was closely tracking any military personnel who celebrated or mocked mr kirk s death and christopher landau the deputy secretary of state suggested the administration would strip visas from individuals who celebrated mr kirk s death i want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country mr landau wrote on x on capitol hill representative clay higgins republican of louisiana said he would use his congressional authority to seek immediate bans for life from social media platforms for anyone who belittled the assassination of charlie kirk i m also going after their business licenses and permitting their businesses will be blacklisted aggressively they should be kicked from every school and their drivers licenses should be revoked he wrote on x i m basically going to cancel with extreme prejudice these evil sick animals who celebrated charlie kirk s assassination i m starting that today mr trump also renewed his call on friday for prosecutors to file racketeering charges against george soros one of the democratic party s biggest donors mr trump and his allies have long claimed without evidence that mr soros foments violent protests we re going to look into soros because i think it s a rico case against him and other people because this is more than protests he said on fox news this is real agitation this is riots on the street and we re going to look into that a spokesman for mr soros s organization open society foundations denied the allegations and called the threats outrageous stephen miller a top adviser to the president characterized the current moment in america as a battle between family and nature and those who celebrate everything that is warped twisted and depraved he said the fate of millions depends upon the defeat of this wicked ideology in an interview on thursday with scott jennings a conservative radio host susie wiles the white house chief of staff said that before mr kirk s death the administration had been working on a more comprehensive plan on violence in america the importance of free speech and civil speech though she did not provide any details white house officials also declined to answer questions about the plan experts warn that the polarization in the country is growing increasingly dire we re watching grief anger blame and calls for retribution all occurring in parallel and all occurring in the public sphere said sean westwood an associate professor of government at dartmouth college and the director of the polarization research lab he added in that kind of environment the loudest voice is going to prevail and in the moment that loudest voice is calling for further division so unlike the past where we ve had leaders pushing us together we now have leaders who are pushing us apart and that could lead to more violence gov spencer cox of utah a republican took a strikingly different approach during the news conference where officials announced the arrest of a suspect on friday mr cox asked for people to lower the political temperature and stay off social media we can return violence with violence we can return hate with hate and that s the problem with political violence is it metastasizes he said because we can always point the finger at the other side and at some point we have to find an off ramp or it s going to get much much worse liberal organizations fear that the trump administration will use the shooting to justify a crackdown on their operations targeting their cash flow nonprofit status or contributors jess o connell a political strategist who co founded the democracy security project said left leaning civil and nonprofit organizations had been grappling with heightened security threats since mr trump took office but the president s explicit calls to crack down on left wing activists have dramatically escalated those fears she said the president has been looking for anything he can use to justify a big crackdown on his perceived political enemies that includes not just nonprofits but civic and cultural organizations she said it s a danger to all of us when the president picks sides on who we should mourn sean kennedy a conservative activist who researches left wing donors at the law enforcement legal defense fund said some scrutiny of liberal money was justified after mr kirk s shooting but not all trump is right to investigate and prosecute left wing purveyors of political violence he said still he added that however abhorrent their ideas may be george soros isn t al capone and the a c l u isn t antifa in utah on thursday officials arrested a 22 year old man tyler robinson in connection with mr kirk s killing investigators said they had found messages inscribed on unfired cartridges in the woods near campus alongside the rifle that had been used in the attack the messages they said suggested familiarity with antifascist symbolism and the irreverent slang of internet memes and role

president trump has sought to oust lisa cook from the federal reserve on grounds that she committed mortgage fraud by falsifying crucial records to obtain more favorable terms on a home loan but new documents call that narrative into question a loan record reviewed by the new york times suggests that ms cook did not try to deceive lenders about one of the properties a home in atlanta that she purchased before joining the nation s central bank in 2022 that document as well as another submitted as part of ms cook s nomination process complicates mr trump s attempts to remove ms cook days after the government asked a federal court to block her from participating in the fed s meeting this coming week where the central bank is expected to lower interest rates on saturday afternoon lawyers for ms cook referenced the newly unearthed documents in urging a panel of judges to allow her to continue serving they also warned that mr trump s actions could cause financial havoc and undermine confidence in the central bank this should be case closed on the cook mortgage issue said adam levitin a professor at georgetown law there is no way to maintain a criminal prosecution in light of the disclosure in cook s loan application ms cook bought the property a condominium in atlanta in 2021 the president and his top aides have accused ms cook of incorrectly claiming both the condo and another property in michigan purchased weeks earlier as her primary residence seemingly in a bid to secure a lower interest rate on a mortgage mr trump and his aides contend that this represents fraud though ms cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing or convicted of a crime but a set of financial records reviewed by the times a preliminary loan estimate from a credit union dated may 2021 offers a possible competing view the documents instead classify that atlanta residence as a vacation home similar language appears in a second set of records furnished later that year to the government ahead of ms cook s confirmation to the fed in those heavily redacted submissions the atlanta condo is described as a 2nd home kathleen c engel an expert on mortgage fraud at suffolk university s law school said that in order to prove fraud prosecutors would need to establish that ms cook misled her lender about her intended use of the property the fraud allegation is dramatically weakened by the evidence that this was on her application ms engel said she was candid about how she was using the property she added it actually rebuts any inference that she engaged in fraud ms cook has said little about her own finances even after mr trump took the extraordinary step last month of trying to fire her mr trump s actions have touched off a landmark legal battle which could see him expand his power to dismiss members of the central bank potentially eroding its independence from political interference the disclosures do not appear to be legal documents and they do not prove that ms cook was transparent about her intended use of the property throughout the loan application process but they do suggest that she may have told her lender about her plans at least once lawyers for ms cook declined to comment on the disclosures which were first reported by reuters but they referenced a news story about the records in their saturday filing with the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit arguing that ms cook had been deprived of a forum in which to offer any evidence in her defense the new revelations did not appear to satisfy ms cook s critics in the trump administration the man at the forefront of her ouster bill pulte the director of the federal housing finance agency who first broadcast allegations of fraud signaled earlier saturday that the newly released records did not absolve ms cook of wrongdoing dr cook represents herself as an extremely accomplished financial operator mr pulte said in a post on social media if dr cook solicited estimates as a vacation home and then entered into a mortgage agreement as a primary residence that is extremely concerning and in my opinion evidences further intent to defraud mr pulte previously referred the matter to the justice department which has opened a criminal investigation into ms cook he said in a second post on social media this weekend the idea that she got estimates and then declared it as a primary on her mortgage agreement is even more concerning for dr cook but ms engel said mr pulte was misunderstanding or misrepresenting the mortgage application process as long as ms cook disclosed her plans to use the home as a secondary home to her lender there is no fraud she said ms engel said she would not necessarily expect publicly available loan documents to show an acknowledgment from her lender that the property would be used as a second home pulte would know this or would have access to people who would know this at f h f a she said the new evidence arrived as the trump administration forged ahead with its attempts to block ms cook from attending a pivotal fed meeting this coming week at which the central bank is expected to lower interest rates the government filed its emergency request with an appeals court on thursday seeking to reverse an earlier decision by a lower court which had blocked the president from firing ms cook the lower court judge ruled that mr trump had failed to identify sufficient cause for dismissing ms cook under the federal reserve act finding that it had to involve behavior while she served as a governor and relate to the job itself ms cook s lawyers have argued that any attempt to prevent her from attending the upcoming fed meeting could rattle financial markets ms cook s counsel repeated those warnings on saturday they told the appellate judges that removing ms cook would send a destabilizing signal to the financial markets that could not be easily undone they also said the government s request risked undermining the fed threatening an immediate end to its history of political independence while opening the door for mr trump to fire other members of the central bank for political reasons nothing would then stop the president from firing other members of the board on similarly flimsy pretexts ms cook s lawyers said the era of fed independence would be over the appeals court has given the trump administration until 3 p m on sunday to respond to ms cook s legal filing kate kelly contributed reporting
on the windswept prairie of south dakota a tribal public radio station is selling off its old records to pay the bills in warm springs ore the npr affiliate is considering dropping all things considered to focus on tribal issues in bunker hill kan population 103 the public tv station may eventually have to cut ties with pbs pulling children s shows like daniel tiger s neighborhood we are crippled here said betsy schwien the general manager of smoky hills pbs in bunker hill it is the absolute worst case scenario the decision by president trump and republicans in congress to strip 500 million from public broadcasters this summer is forcing profound changes that will reshape the airwaves especially in rural and tribal areas of the country some stations are beginning to go off the air as congress was warned before it went ahead and eliminated funding for the corporation for public broadcasting the taxpayer backed company that supports public media ultimately shutting it down but short of that no station will be immune from impacts npr and pbs aware of the strain have lowered fees for impacted stations but for many that s not enough some are considering dropping nationally produced shows from npr and pbs amid enormous budget shortfalls florida public media an association of 24 npr and pbs stations last month sent a letter to npr s chief executive katherine maher pleading for lower program fees simply put the fee relief plan npr has proposed is not sufficient to keep many npr programs on the air in much of florida the stations wrote in some states like florida state funding has also been cut some are turning to grants and emergency membership drives and considering higher fees on corporate sponsors to stanch the bleeding others fielding complaints from their members are voicing worries about the political balance in news coverage a delicate issue for station directors in red states republicans have long complained about what they call a liberal bias in public broadcasting but if rural npr affiliates shed national shows like all things considered and morning edition the airwaves would give listeners few alternatives to conservative talk radio in many areas for most americans public radio and television won t disappear npr and pbs aren t going away and many stations in the biggest cities will withstand the cuts but the sudden loss of government support is transforming a cultural touchstone that has endured for more than a half century public media leaders will need to be more open to ideas that might have been discarded in the past said steve bass a public media consultant next year will mark the 40th year since kwso 91 9 fm a public radio station owned and operated by the confederated tribes of warm springs in north central oregon began airing a round the clock mix of news cultural programming music and community announcements but what the station will look like beyond that anniversary is just a great unknown said sue matters the longtime station manager about 40 percent of its 600 000 annual budget which pays for six full time employees comes from the corporation for public broadcasting that will soon be gone i d say i m looking to replace 200 000 ballpark ms matters said to fill that hole everything is on the table she said including national programming such as all things considered she wants instead to prioritize what makes the station a community bulwark lessons for the tribes three languages announcements for the warm springs k 8 public school coverage of football and other sports from madras high school and native america calling a national live call in program for public radio stations to generate more revenue she is mulling potentially increasing the rates she charges for sponsorships and corporate support selling clothing and merchandise and even starting a food cart station management has requested additional funding from the tribe which provides 40 percent of kwso s budget and so far there appears to be a willingness at least in the short run to cover things like programming fees and subcontracts for the station s automation system website and app but ms matters worries about a zero sum effect that funding could be going to other things that meet people s needs like food or housing she said the station s transmitter atop eagle butte offers commanding views of mt hood and mt jefferson in the distance and the reservation s kah nee ta hot springs resort in the valley below and a good thing too she said because kwso is typically the only station offering local and community news that the reservation s 4 500 local residents can hear especially given the nooks and crannies of the adjacent cascades internet access on the warm springs reservation which encompasses 1 000 square miles is spotty at best cellphones often have no bars or display sos and in a community where the median household income of 58 900 is three quarters the national average maybe 40 percent of residents don t have television access either since they can t afford satellite television services said daniel martinez the tribal emergency manager that leaves kwso it s our conduit to the community mr martinez said those concerns were echoed throughout the reservation if we lose the radio station it s like you lose an arm or a leg you lose a foot carlos calica vice chair of the tribal council said at an end of summer powwow last spring when mr trump and his allies in congress called for the defunding of public broadcasting they insisted they were pursuing more political balance on the nation s airwaves the president called npr and pbs radical left monsters while the white house in an announcement formally asking congress to claw back funds already allocated to the corporation for public broadcasting dismissed its programming as woke propaganda disguised as news but with the corporation now gone the question confronting much of the country where airwaves are dominated by the chain stations of sinclair broadcasting and iheartradio will be how any news can compete with the political right in the badlands of south dakota the airwaves are saturated with unapologetic conservatism the road to the pine ridge reservation cuts through a sea of prairie grass while over the radio on 90 3 a former lawyer for mr trump rails against the radical left up the dial between christian pop and classic rock other syndicated shows argue against in vitro fertilization and feminism kili the voice of the lakota nation has been a counterpoint of sorts but it is now struggling for its life this is scary said oitancan zephier manager of the independent station kili is the primary source of local news for one of the poorest parts of the country delivering updates on tribal politics wildfires and road closures from a creaky studio where rain sometimes leaks through the foam soundproofing and a stray dog snoozes in the vestibule the station has dealt with money troubles and shoestring budgets since its founding 40 years ago but the loss of around half its annual income about 180 000 from the corporation for public broadcasting is a different scale of stress we don t know what next year holds for us mr zephier said in a worst case scenario mr zephier said kili could switch to all software programming meaning that the flesh and blood d j s who play lakota prayers to start programming every day tell lakota language jokes to connect with elders listening from home and give updates in emergencies would give way to automation to avoid that the station is trying to sell stacks of old records its website is trying to entice donations from sympathetic listeners by declaring that kili is under attack meanwhile mr zephier is hunting for grants and donations but with its high rates of poverty and unemployment pine ridge isn t exactly fertile ground for pledge drives said david american horse who is part of kili s weekly voices of the elders program we are barely surviving as a people he said we don t have the option of passing around a hat or doing a gofundme senator mike rounds a south dakota republican who voted to cut public broadcasting funds has said he has secured 9 4 million for tribal broadcasters but kili s board members and staff are unsure whether they will see any of it or whether it will be enough when she started her job nearly four years ago ms schwien the general manager of smoky hills pbs near the geographic center of kansas was holding the organization together with the equivalent of scotch tape and rubber bands the only pbs station for more than 100 miles was housed in a limestone relic from the 1800s with a defunct toilet and a fly infestation employees think it s haunted then she got a

a federal judge late friday ruled that the trump administration s mass firing of probationary employees earlier this year was illegal a victory for the labor unions and nonprofit groups that had sued the government over the terminations the ruling did not call on the government to return the fired probationary employees to their jobs as would be the ordinary course judge william h alsup of the northern district of california wrote in a 38 page opinion because the supreme court allowed the administration to continue its purge for months while the case proceeded he said too much water has now passed under the bridge many of the fired probationary workers in the 17 agencies covered in the lawsuit have been reinstated to their posts have found new jobs or do not want to return to their old jobs judge alsup said and for some workers agency reorganizations over the past few months have eliminated their positions even so the plaintiffs saw the ruling as a significant win judge alsup s decision makes clear that thousands of probationary workers were wrongfully fired exposes the sham record the government relied upon and requires the government to tell the wrongly terminated employees that o p m s reasoning for firing them was false everett kelley the president of the american federation of government employees said in a statement on saturday using an acronym for the office of personnel management the government s human resources arm the agency took a leading role in the trump administration s early downsizing efforts led by elon musk s department of government efficiency judge alsup found the terminations illegal because they came at the direction of the personnel office and not the agencies where the employees worked which hold the authority to hire and fire he ordered that the personnel office be prohibited from firing federal employees the way it had done earlier this year the probationary firings were part of a series of federal worker termination programs launched by the trump administration all of which face legal challenges the u s court of appeals for the fourth circuit recently ruled that a maryland case challenging the probationary firings should be sent back to the district court and dismissed because the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue in friday s opinion judge alsup chided the administration over its conduct in the monthslong case he said the government s evidence was a sham that included documents unrelated to the case leaving a reader with the feeling that he is being led blindfolded along a carefully plotted path through a dense unseen wood here and there he may hear a rustle in the trees feel the dark silhouette of a towering form or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond but never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes judge alsup wrote in some cases he said the government offered fabricated context and ersatz evidence he called some prosecutor conduct chicanery echoing observations he had shared at times during the case he appeared particularly angered by the government s insistence that the fired workers had ways outside of district courts to challenge their dismissals mr trump effectively disabled those options when he fired people in key positions judge alsup noted the judge singled out the federal labor relations authority an independent board that reviews unfair labor practices mr trump fired the chair of the board significantly slowing its work mr trump also fired a member of the merit systems protection board where many of the probationary employees turned to challenge their firings that left the panel without a quorum and unable to make decisions and the president fired the head of the office of special counsel which protects whistle blowers installing a loyalist in his place judge alsup ordered 17 agencies to issue letters to each fired probationary worker stating you were not terminated on the basis of your personal performance when he issued a similar order earlier this year some agencies complied but included legal language that the government did not agree with the court s opinion judge alsup said the agencies were free to disagree with his opinion and appeal the ruling but that the letters were not an appropriate medium for the litigation of those disagreements
a federal judge on saturday denounced the trump administration for what she said appeared to be a deliberate scheme to ignore court ordered protections for a group of deported immigrants who feared persecution in their home countries of nigeria and gambia but judge tanya s chutkan of the u s district court for the district of columbia appeared reluctant to order the return of the five migrants to the united states instead asking the government to submit a sworn statement detailing its efforts to prevent the deportations of the people to their home countries repatriating the migrants would violate the protections they had received from immigration judges in the united states an emergency hearing in the case on saturday demonstrated how the supreme court had paved the way for the deportation of the five migrants in the case and for president trump s mass deportation campaign more broadly though she appeared highly skeptical of the government s arguments judge chutkan said that her hands may be tied and expressed doubt that a ruling in the migrants favor would survive on appeal pointing to several recent legal victories for the trump administration s deportation policies judge chutkan ultimately did not instruct the government to take specific action on the five deported migrants and gave lawyers in the case more time to prepare their arguments it is unclear if more members of the group of deported migrants will soon be deported to their home countries in a recent deal with the trump administration ghana agreed to accept deported migrants with no connection to the west african nation federal officials then deported 14 migrants to ghana last week five of whom had judges orders preventing their deportation to their home countries of nigeria and gambia but the five migrants were told by u s and ghanaian officials that they would be sent to their home countries anyway according to court filings one of them a bisexual man from gambia where same sex relationships are criminalized was sent on wednesday from ghana to his home country the other four plaintiffs are still in ghana and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent even as judge chutkan scolded the trump administration for allowing ghanaian officials to violate orders by u s immigration judges she also appeared to suggest that she had little power to compel the government to return the migrants at least for now i have not been shy about saying that i think this is a very suspicious scheme she said during a hearing on saturday adding that the supreme court had blocked a lower court decision in a similar case earlier this year and there s no point in getting decisions from me that are immediately going to be stayed judge chutkan s remarks as well as her reluctance to compel the government to return the migrants amounted to a significant victory for the trump administration in its mass deportation campaign the supreme court has broadly allowed the government to deport migrants to countries other than their own and had paused a federal judge s ruling that said the migrants must first be given a chance to show that they would be at risk of torture justice department lawyers in defending the deportations did not dispute that ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court ordered protections the lawyers instead leaned on an argument that the trump administration had previously used in the case of kilmar armando abrego garcia effectively saying that once a migrant had been removed from the united states and was in foreign custody the issue was out of their hands the united states is not saying that this is ok elianis n p rez a justice department lawyer said during the hearing what the united states is saying is that the united states does not have the power to tell ghana what to do judge chutkan appeared skeptical of that argument saying that the lack of that power appears to be by design and that it was intended as an end run around the united states obligations she added you send these individuals knowing you can t repatriate them you send them to ghana and you say oh but ghana says they re not going to send them home and ghana immediately prepares to send them home with what appears to be your full awareness how is this not a violation of your obligation the case echoes mr abrego garcia s in other ways one type of legal protection for the five migrants includes a status called withholding of removal the same protection that should have prevented mr abrego garcia s wrongful deportation to his home country of el salvador he has continued to fight a labyrinthine legal battle against his deportation and the trump administration has now sought to deport him to several other african countries that have also agreed to accept deported migrants a so called third country deportation the five plaintiffs in the ghana case identified only by their initials for fear of persecution in their home counties are citizens of nigeria and gambia and have been described in court filings by their lawyers as having abysmal living conditions in a remote detention facility known as dema camp at an undisclosed location in ghana one man known in court records as k s was deported to gambia despite the fact that he had been granted a legal protection preventing deportation to his home country on the basis of his sexuality k s is a bisexual man and gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life in prison k s according to a court filing is now in hiding in gambia and fears for his life
secretary of state marco rubio departed for israel on saturday amid signs that president trump was growing frustrated about prime minister benjamin netanyahu s unrelenting campaign against hamas prolonging the war in gaza mr rubio will land in israel on sunday as its military prepares for a major offensive in gaza city his visit comes days after an audacious israeli airstrike targeted hamas officials in qatar arab and european officials have said that the attack would make ending the conflict even harder before his departure on saturday mr rubio told reporters that the israeli strike in qatar would be a focus of his conversations in israel and what impact it s going to have on efforts to get all the hostages back get rid of hamas and end this war that s the president s priority mr trump told reporters this week that he was very unhappy about the israeli strike in doha qatar s capital saying that it does not advance israel or america s goals mr trump has promised to broker an end to the nearly two year gaza conflict and earlier this month submitted a fresh cease fire proposal which he said israel had accepted but the fighting has raged on for that mr trump and israel blame hamas saying that the palestinian militant group negotiates in bad faith mr netanyahu s critics say he has willingly prolonged the war prioritizing the dismantling of hamas over the release of some 20 israeli hostages who remain in gaza mr trump has done little to press mr netanyahu to reach terms with hamas apart from his sporadic demands that israel allow more aid into gaza to prevent mass famine a state department statement announcing mr rubio s travel and outlining his agenda did not express concern about the coming israeli offensive into gaza city ahead of which israel has ordered all residents to evacuate the statement said that mr rubio who also serves as mr trump s national security adviser would meet with israeli officials to discuss their goals and objectives for the operation mr rubio deflected on saturday when asked whether the united states fully supports an offensive into gaza city i m not going to get into that in the media other than to say that the president wants this to be finished with he said referring to the gaza war generally but mr rubio may urge israel to conduct a swift operation said david makovsky a former state department adviser who advised israel palestinian peace talks and now works at the washington institute for near east policy the country could then move toward the political settlement that mr trump who does not conceal his longing for a nobel peace prize hopes to clinch i tend to think his time frame is to do it quickly mr makovsky said but he added that a u s push to get it over with may not comport with the reality on the ground the prospect of grueling urban warfare in the devastated gazan capital it is unclear whether mr rubio will rebuke israeli officials over the strike in qatar a close u s partner that hosts a major american air base on friday the foreign ministers of france germany and britain issued a joint statement condemning the attack as a violation of qatar s sovereignty and said it poses a serious risk to achieving a negotiated deal to end the gaza war but such differences between the trump administration and mr netanyahu appear largely tactical and in the swelling international debate about israel s approach to the palestinians mr rubio appears sure to defend mr netanyahu s hard line government calls for recognizing a palestinian state are growing in major western capitals which like the united states have long held that statehood can only result from mutual agreement by israel but several countries including france and canada said in july that they would recognize a palestinian state at the united nations general assembly in new york this month while such recognition would be symbolic the idea infuriates israeli officials who say it amounts to a reward for hamas s oct 7 2023 attacks in israel trump administration officials have also denounced the move even mr rubio s predecessor as secretary of state antony j blinken wrote last month that the idea was morally right but premature as a practical matter in a ceremony on thursday celebrating new israeli settlements in the west bank mr netanyahu defiantly insisted that such a state whose creation would almost certainly require territorial concessions by israel would never become reality we said there will be no palestinian state and indeed there will be no palestinian state the israeli leader declared this place is ours during his visit mr rubio will reiterate the trump administration s commitment to fight anti israel actions including unilateral recognition of a palestinian state that rewards hamas terrorism the state department s statement said while mr trump s support for mr netanyahu has come at little political cost that could change the length and human toll of the gaza war as well as the airstrike in qatar have put severe pressure on israel s alliances with gulf arab states so has growing talk among mr netanyahu s right wing allies about annexing the west bank arab officials have warned that mr netanyahu s actions are threatening the abraham accords agreements brokered by mr trump in his first term that established formal diplomatic relations between israel and several arab states including bahrain and the united arab emirates mr rubio s meetings in israel will be on monday the five year anniversary of the accords mr trump claims the abraham accords as one of his proudest achievements and he hopes to extend them to include saudi arabia analysts say there is little chance of that happening anytime soon and warn that the existing accords could themselves be in danger earlier this month a top emirati official said that israel s annexation of the west bank would be a red line that would end the vision of regional integration in what some analysts read as an implicit reference to a potential withdrawal from the accords it is unclear how those tensions might be resolved according to mr makovsky the former state department official i m just concerned that we re entering this escalatory phase right now and we don t know the end he said there s no off ramp mr netanyahu s approach he added is to just keep going
on live television for the past two weeks brazil has watched five supreme court justices convict former president jair bolsonaro of attempting a coup and sentence him to 27 years in prison he could report to prison next month at the same time in private meetings across a plaza from the trial some members of brazil s congress have been discussing how to free him the debate is over whether to grant mr bolsonaro and his fellow defendants amnesty absolving them of their crimes of trying to overturn the 2022 election and it has been churning in brazil for weeks casting a shadow over a young democracy with a long history of coups members of congress have already been circulating legislation television commentators have been speculating about the chances and dueling protesters on each side have been chanting for and against it activists have even projected no amnesty with the brazilian flag on tower bridge in london amnesty has quickly become so central to the national conversation in brazil that as mr bolsonaro was being tried this past week it was the elephant in the courtroom sure the former president was about to be convicted but for how long it is far from certain that mr bolsonaro will eventually be absolved and the legislative and legal process has a long way to go before that could happen but that amnesty had already become such a prominent topic even before a verdict says much about brazil its politics and its history amnesty is a tradition in our country said ciro nogueira mr bolsonaro s former chief of staff who as one of leaders in the senate is now pushing for amnesty it has been a way to bring peace and turn the page on the conflicts otherwise you remain stuck with them forever brazil emerged from a monarchy in 1889 via a coup between then and 2022 the nation experienced another 14 military coups half of them successful in every failed attempt the plotters were granted amnesty and were never prosecuted that means thursday was the first time that brazil has convicted leaders of an attempted coup with links to the military in addition to mr bolsonaro the supreme court convicted seven other men including mr bolsonaro s running mate defense minister national security adviser and navy commander nearly all face lengthy prison sentences it is totally unprecedented said carlos fico a brazilian historian and the author of brazilian authoritarian utopia a book on the country s history of coups there has never been punishment for the plotters of a military coup instead brazilian leaders have repeatedly reached for amnesty after destabilizing moments a bid to ease unrest and move on mr fico said yet that has come with consequences the lack of punishment for coup attempts only brings a temporary pacification because it actually encourages a new coup attempt said fernando gabeira a former brazilian congressman and prominent political analyst it doesn t work because people feel encouraged to try again mr gabeira has his own history with amnesty in 1964 brazil s military carried out its most consequential coup launching a dictatorship that lasted two decades five years later mr gabeira helped kidnap the u s ambassador to brazil to protest american support for the dictatorship his leftist group secured the release of 15 political prisoners before releasing the ambassador but he never faced significant consequences for the kidnapping that is because in 1979 brazil passed a broad amnesty law for political crimes it paved the way for the peaceful end to the dictatorship but it also meant that very few faced justice for their actions during the dictatorship including the democratic activists who fought back with violence and the military officials who kidnapped jailed tortured and disappeared political opponents by contrast neighbors like argentina chile and uruguay experienced similar dictatorships but have prosecuted many of the military leaders who carried them out brazil s approach reflects its political culture of conciliation the current president luiz in cio lula da silva was once imprisoned on a corruption conviction for 580 days but the case was later thrown out and he returned to power that same corruption scandal operation car wash once gripped the country after it was revealed that companies had paid billions of dollars in bribes to government officials but in recent years judges have quietly set aside convictions and suspended enormous fines now many people wonder if it all could happen again with mr bolsonaro if amnesty passes then that old saying that many people repeat that brazil is the country of impunity will truly become reality martele pereira da silva 62 a nutritionist said this past week at a protest against amnesty in rio de janeiro the answer now lies with brazil s congress much of the debate will focus on whether to grant amnesty to mr bolsonaro and his co conspirators or only to people convicted of ransacking brazil s halls of power in january 2023 in a riot intended to provoke a military takeover the rioters sentences have been widely criticized as overly harsh including a 14 year sentence given to one woman who used lipstick to vandalize an outdoor statue the supreme court one of the main targets of the riots handed down the sentences a survey of 2 000 brazilians released saturday showed that 54 percent opposed amnesty for mr bolsonaro while 39 percent said they supported it support for giving the rioters amnesty is even lower yet in brazil s lower chamber of congress amnesty appears to have enough votes after that there are many hurdles there may also be enough votes in the senate the upper chamber but the senate s president has said he would not bring the issue to a vote mr lula would almost certainly veto any amnesty though congress could overturn that and then the law would also have to survive a likely challenge in the supreme court which has spent years prosecuting mr bolsonaro another route would have congress pass a law to reduce sentencing requirements for mr bolsonaro s crimes requiring a reduction in his sentence hovering over the debate is next year s presidential election mr bolsonaro is ineligible to run but he remains the most popular politician on brazil s right analysts speculate that congressional and party leaders could be offering mr bolsonaro amnesty in exchange for his endorsement of a more moderate candidate in the election mr nogueira mr bolsonaro s ally in the senate denied that the next president could also pardon mr bolsonaro though the supreme court has ruled that pardons cannot be used to protect a political ally mr bolsonaro s best bet to avoid prison is his expected request to serve his sentence under house arrest because of lingering medical problems from a stabbing he suffered on the campaign trail in 2018 he recently underwent major surgery and he watched his trial from home because his lawyers said his health is so poor another former brazilian president fernando collor is serving a sentence for corruption at home because of health issues if mr bolsonaro is sent to prison he still will most likely end up in a less restrictive system within several years able to work outside the prison during the day for instance because of brazilian law where mr bolsonaro serves his sentence will be decided largely by alexandre de moraes the supreme court justice who led the investigation into the former president and as a result became a target of the right when closing the trial on thursday he made clear that amnesty had not worked in the past what leads to peace is due process a public and transparent trial like this one justice moraes said this is what leads to the healing of wounds the strengthening of democracy and ensuring that neither a coup attempt nor the abolition of the democratic state ever occurs again ana ionova contributed reporting lis moriconi contributed research
for more than a decade lisbon has been the place to be after economic near death experiences in the early 2010s portugal used tax breaks golden visas and inclusive social and immigration policies to attract foreign investors digital nomads and surf happy expatriates who formed a cosmopolitan class living it up on the low cost of living luxury towers and hotels sprouted up over long abandoned areas and graffitied streets often inhabited by poor immigrants who supplied cheap labor the city s most handsome neighborhoods with their tiled facades and parks filled with people drinking cocktails at cafes over the sounds of bossa nova and english became a modern day casablanca for creative types about 30 percent of lisbon s population is not portuguese that dreamy image of lisbon as an innovative city on a hill suffered a jarring disruption this month an iconic funicular beloved by tourists for its old lisbon charm sped out of control on a steep incline and crashed into a wall the accident killed 16 people mostly foreigners now in the political hothouse of an upcoming mayoral election advocates of increasingly alienated and frustrated locals have seized on the accident to ask what lisbon has become and whom it is for they argue that in its courting of wealthy transplants lisbon has created gross inequality and priced locals out of their neighborhoods an administration focused on keeping alive the aura of innovation and growth they say has failed to maintain lisbon s basic infrastructure and character we are a victim of our own success said rui bochmann franco a left leaning city councilor who lost a friend in the accident as mr franco rode an elevator in the city council building the other day he pointed to an outdated inspection notice that he said he had told the mayor about remind you of something he asked meaning the funicular the crash he said shows that they invest a lot in showing off but clearly not enough in basic safety standards investigators are still trying to determine the exact cause of the crash lisbon s center right mayor carlos moedas has rejected calls to step down in an interview mr moedas said the crash had been politicized and called that disgusting he said maintenance of the funicular which was subcontracted to private companies was not the cause of the accident but he also said it was necessary to wait for the findings of the investigation to explain what happened he also said he had increased elevator inspections on one thing at least he and his critics agree the main challenge facing lisbon is managing its growth and avoiding its becoming a city of foreign haves and local have nots lisbon became trendy and portugal became trendy mr moedas said i think that s not bad but he added we really have to protect the people of the city and make sure that people that are from here are not disadvantaged by people coming here he warned that pitting the city s classes against one another was very dangerous and anathema to its cosmopolitan tradition imagine i put a ban on people he said what would that change would that change for better it would not a center right emblem of the new lisbon mr moedas graduated from harvard business school worked at goldman sachs and started an investment management company he then oversaw a portuguese agency that put austerity reforms in place and became a european union commissioner for innovation elected lisbon s mayor in 2021 he has an office lined with contemporary art his wife is of moroccan and tunisian descent he argued that it was vital for lisbon to retain its inclusive character in a competitive global marketplace for entrepreneurs and companies that would create opportunities for homegrown talent to stay put and earn better wages he had sought he said to compensate those the new economy left behind by providing public services and subsidies including free public transportation for the young and elderly his administration had also increased health services and put hundreds of millions of euros into housing he said 12 percent of lisbon s population lived in subsidized municipal housing but some in lisbon s middle class earning lower salaries than many foreigners take a dimmer view on a street behind the steep hill where the funicular crashed rodrigo jesus 26 works as an interior designer for a company that serves airbnb and other firms catering to tourists and foreign residents the development in lisbon has been good for his company he said but it s not good for me he said he was priced out of the lisbon market and had to buy a house in another town and he said it annoyed him that every time he walked into a store people spoke to him in english because he had red hair some tech entrepreneurs say lisbon s international vibe and the preponderance of english as the new lingua franca make them feel welcome oliver schmalholz 53 a tech entrepreneur from germany who spent 15 years in austin texas when it was the darling of the tech world moved to lisbon in 2021 he said he fell for the cosmopolitan city and didn t feel like an outsider he said he attended the mayor s tech incubator the unicorn factory in a once abandoned part of the city and hired for his start up 15 local engineers who might have otherwise left the country he is engaged to a portuguese woman and lives in the infinity a luxury high rise he said his neighbors were international and included a lot of golden visa buyers who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on real estate investments to gain legal immigration status in portugal he worried that recent measures restricting such visas amounted to the state s killing the golden goose but he also acknowledged that people outside the tech sector including doctors and nurses were being priced out of lisbon s center we need the locals he said but many locals are leaving one major reason is the high real estate prices driven up by foreign residents and speculative investors locals have added to the problem by converting their own homes into airbnbs you hear the noise of the construction that s lisbon now poor immigrants working on luxury housing for rich immigrants said ana drago a former left wing member of parliament and now a researcher in urban studies she argued that portugal s main export was its own real estate that the wealthy foreigner class that moved here seems cosmopolitan but we know it s not for us we feel like we are being expelled she said it was simply said ant nio brito guterres a social worker active in one of the city s hipster havens settler colonialism still many here say the city has improved enormously in the last decades where before there were open drug markets and abandoned lots there are now gleaming hotels and pleasant plazas more young professional portuguese working for an influx of new companies have stayed instead of leaving the country but on a recent morning at the site of the crash where memorial bouquets bore canadian flags r i p notes for americans and a toy mini cooper some locals wondered what the accident said about their city i don t blame the rich people who move to lisbon said mario rodrigues 74 who said he had intended to vote for the mayor but now wasn t so sure all the foreign investment he said should be used for the protection of people who live in lisbon tiago carrasco contributed reporting from

senator chris van hollen democrat of maryland endorsed zohran mamdani for mayor of new york city on saturday and called on his party s leadership to do the same criticizing them for a delay that he said had allowed president trump to exploit democratic divisions mr van hollen said mr mamdani the party s nominee was focused on ensuring that people can afford to live in the place where they work a goal that donald trump and new york s financial elites see that as a threat yet many democratic members of the senate and the house representing new york have stayed on the sidelines mr van hollen told a cheering group of democratic activists and officials gathered on saturday afternoon in des moines that kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of they need to get behind him and get behind him now mr van hollen isn t alone in suggesting it is time for the national party to get behind mr mamdani a 33 year old state assemblyman and democratic socialist in recent days a series of democrats across the ideological spectrum have argued that it is important for their leaders to forcefully reject mr trump s apparent interest in tipping the race toward former gov andrew cuomo a lifelong democrat who is running in the mayoral race as an independent after losing the primary to mr mamdani mr trump and his aides allies and donors have gone to extraordinary efforts to meddle in the race and improve the chances of mr cuomo though mr trump now appears increasingly resigned to a potential victory by mr mamdani mr van hollen s remarks delivered at the polk county steak fry an annual party fund raiser that frequently draws top democrats underscore how mr mamdani s rise has captured the imagination of both national parties republicans have tried to use his primary victory to paint a broad swath of democratic candidates as aligned with socialism and the far left wing of their party democrats have praised his focus on affordability and savvy use of social media as a model for their candidates nationwide though many have been wary of fully embracing him democratic leaders including representative hakeem jeffries the house democratic leader senator chuck schumer the minority leader and gov kathy hochul have so far declined to endorse his bid despite his resounding primary victory in june their reluctance has frustrated the left wing of their party who have typically rallied behind more moderate picks such as former president joseph r biden jr in his remarks mr van hollen cast the hesitancy of democratic officials and strategists as a political mistake particularly at a time when surveys show voters hold very unfavorable perceptions of the democratic brand we ve become a party that too often trims its sails too cautious too rudderless too attached to poll washed pundit rinsed and donor dried messages he said what comes out of the wash is all bleached and blow dried mr schumer met with mr mamdani earlier this week and said they would keep talking ms hochul also said she and mr mamdani had been having conversations mr jeffries has hinted that he was moving toward a decision saying he would address the election in the coming weeks leader hakeem jeffries will have more to say about the general election well in advance of nov 4 said justin chermol a spokesman for mr jeffries meanwhile confused new yorkers are asking themselves the question chris van who some democratic leaders have urged their party to focus intensively on kitchen table economic issues like high prices mr van hollen argued that those economic arguments should not come at the expense of his party challenging the administration on issues like deportations redistricting and political violence he laid out an agenda for the party that included regulating technology companies curbing money in politics reforming the tax code sane and fair immigration reform lowering prices and raising wages and taking a tougher approach to prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel in his remarks mr van hollen cited his involvement in fighting for the return of kilmar armando abrego garcia a maryland man who was wrongfully deported by the trump administration to el salvador in the spring some in his party he said argued that getting embroiled in a fight over a deportation was a distraction and potentially politically unpopular because mr trump s hard line on immigration had resonated with voters mr van hollen saw a different lesson this finger in the wind stuff has got to end we also need to stop deluding ourselves that the problem is all about messaging or about volume or style he said we don t just need to fight we need to fight for something
he received a lengthy and warm introduction from one of the mosque s leaders and rose from his chair then as congregants watched with some bemusement former gov andrew m cuomo stared intensely at a small notecard and mangled a traditional arabic greeting assalam alaikum he finally said haltingly and after several attempts the slip up might not come as a surprise though mr cuomo has held frequent events at churches synagogues and sikh temples friday s visit to the futa islamic center in the bronx was his first campaign event held at a mosque since he declared his run for mayor in march mr cuomo who served as governor of new york for 10 years faced widespread criticism after he struggled during a primary debate to remember the last time he had visited a mosque at all in his remarks on friday mr cuomo spoke of new york as a beacon for newcomers seeking economic opportunity a message that seemed to resonate with many congregants of the mosque many of whom emigrated from west africa mr cuomo told the congregants that his grandfather s journey from italy nearly 100 years ago was no different than theirs and said that if elected he would ensure they found the success that had brought them to new york in the first place and in a tacit response to the front runner in the mayor s race assemblyman zohran mamdani who captured the democratic nomination by focusing on affordability mr cuomo said he would make buses and subways free for families making less than 50 000 and work to reduce the cost of housing people talk about affordability he said affordability is a new fancy word because they have to come up with a new fancy word for an old problem the old problem is the middle class the working families the poor are under tremendous economic pressure his appearance on friday before dozens of congregants was emblematic of the more visible approach to campaigning mr cuomo has taken since losing the democratic primary to mr mamdani himself a muslim who has stopped by this congregation multiple times recent polls show mr cuomo who is now campaigning as an independent running far behind mr mamdani as are curtis sliwa the republican nominee and mayor eric adams who is also running as an independent mr adams campaigned on friday at a nearby mosque that predominantly serves west african immigrants as well mamadou diallo a leader at the futa islamic center who spoke after mr cuomo said that it was no surprise candidates were flocking to mosques and that muslim new yorkers wanted their voices to be heard he expressed hope that if mr cuomo were to be elected he would return and address their concerns about housing costs and crime mr diallo 39 said he was unsure who he would support but he added that many congregants had fond memories of mr cuomo s governorship boubacar sowlamougom 60 a security guard who is originally from guinea said he appreciated mr cuomo s efforts to raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour during his governorship he did a good job he said others in attendance like osmane diallo 23 were less impressed with mr cuomo mr diallo said he supported mr mamdani in the primary and found mr cuomo s visit coming only now when the general election was nearing cynical his time has passed he said while acknowledging that mr cuomo had done good work as governor on gun violence prevention we need new politicians with fresh ideas in june weeks before the democratic primary mr cuomo touted the endorsements of over 100 faith leaders a list that included two imams from brooklyn in interviews on friday both of them told the new york times that they had never endorsed the former governor s campaign and had been incorrectly included on the list we were expecting his team to reach out to us and have a meeting the team did not respond at all said one of the imams muhammad siddiqui of al madina mosque islamic center of brooklyn that s what our experience was and then they put our name on a list rather than frustration it was carelessness right now we are not in position to endorse anyone until we have a serious conversation with them the other imam ahmed ali of the igra masjid mosque said his congregation had a similar experience in the spring it was a miscommunication imam ali said adding that the former governor should have come and spoken with us rich azzopardi mr cuomo s spokesman said including the imams had been a mistake the times reviewed internal cuomo campaign correspondence that appeared to indicate that there had been a mix up between two members of the campaign staff one of whom had told another that the endorsements were confirmed mr cuomo s appearance friday came in the aftermath of a paroxysm of political violence and the day after the 24th anniversary of the sept 11 attacks mr cuomo alluded to the division in the country presently but on friday eschewed attacking his opponent by name in recent weeks he has increased the intensity of his criticisms of mr mamdani whom he has called a terrorist sympathizer mr mamdani has been a frequent critic of the israeli government and its invasion of gaza but has forcefully pushed back on the notion he is antisemitic and has earned the support of many of the city s jewish residents mr mamdani has also spoken bracingly about the experience of growing up as a muslim in new york city in the aftermath of 9 11 on friday reflecting on the precarious moment for many immigrants under president trump a local lawyer spoke before mr cuomo and explained recent policy changes relating to how immigration and customs enforcement agents can detain people when he finished about a dozen congregants asked for his card and still more circulated one of the cards so others could take photos of it during mr trump s first term mr cuomo was a loud critic of the administration s travel ban on residents of predominantly muslim countries which was eventually overturned earlier in his tenure mr cuomo defended the construction of a mosque that was being planned near the former site of the world trade center as a new yorker i am a muslim as a new yorker i am jewish mr cuomo said in january 2017 as a new yorker we are one community he added and the new york community is composed of all of the above but during the primary mr cuomo s opponents especially mr mamdani said his failure to visit any mosques or islamic cultural centers while campaigning was evidence of how he was out of touch with the diversity of the city which is home to hundreds of thousands of muslims mr cuomo faced similar criticism for not visiting mosques as governor during his 2018 run for re election his primary opponent cynthia nixon criticized his lack of outreach to muslim new yorkers later that year mr cuomo visited the islamic cultural center of new york on the upper east side of manhattan according to his public schedule at the time imam ali who was mistakenly included on the cuomo campaign s list said he was unsure who he would support in the general election and hoped that he and his congregants would hear from all the candidates he said he had appreciated mr mamdani s criticisms of israel s conduct in gaza and his response during a primary debate to a question about where he would travel first if elected mayor mr mamdani said he would stay in new york city mr cuomo answering the same question said he would travel to israel whomever he supports imam ali who is originally from pakistan and has lived in the united states for more than 20 years said mr mamdani s ascendance was a milestone for all muslims people will say that the muslim vote matters he said we will have a voice in the city
she has portrayed a rebellious android westworld a hard drinking valkyrie thor ragnarok a physicist trapped in an extraterrestrial prism annihilation and a songstress with progressive hearing loss creed but of all the provocative and varied characters that tessa thompson 41 has embodied over the last 20 years few can match the mythology surrounding hedda gabler the fatefully unhappy housewife conjured by the norwegian playwright henrik ibsen in his seminal 1891 stage drama of the same name it s a role so faceted so rich in sturm und drang many have called hedda the female hamlet that actresses including ingrid bergman glenda jackson isabelle huppert annette bening cate blanchett mary louise parker and rosamund pike have flocked to play her this fall thompson will star in a big screen adaptation by the filmmaker nia dacosta the marvels candyman that puts her boldly reimagined hedda both queer and biracial at the center of a hedonistic midcentury house party on a lavish english estate illicit romances are pursued careers derailed and psyches unraveled more than one gun goes off in the night the actress sat down with the new york times at amazon s manhattan office to discuss hedda which opens in limited release on oct 22 and begins streaming on prime on oct 29 and some of the more radical swerves it takes with the source material here are edited excerpts from that conversation a lot of people who know you from marvel movies or indie films like sorry to bother you may not know your background in theater or that your career started at the los angeles women s shakespeare company when did you first encounter hedda gabler well the first ibsen i read was actually a doll s house when i was maybe 17 18 and i remember being really obsessed there was something so provocative and daring i couldn t believe that it had been written so long ago then i got into hedda but i think what it speaks to also is a dearth of when you talk about the classics there are incredible plays but are there a million incredible parts for women not necessarily and so hedda remains one of those ones that has its own iconography and history and reputation you and nia first worked together on the 2018 sundance drama little woods did she already have a hedda vision in her head back then a handful of years ago she told me that she had been thinking about it and wrestling with it she had gone to see a production of hedda and felt underwhelmed so i think in terms of the big architectural changes that she made to the piece those were always inherent to the adaptation that she built from the ground up one major switch involves the gender of the brilliant but alcoholic professor dr lovborg who is hedda s former lover and as she learns in the first act her new husband s rival for a plum teaching position now lovborg is played by the german actress nina hoss who is probably best known in america for t r how did that come about i think the reason these great works are so dexterous is because they contain these fundamental questions and ideas that we ll wrestle with until the end of time but there s something frankly just more interesting about trying to translate it to a modern audience in a way that feels fresh and new and asking the same question in a way it hasn t been asked before that was always nia s intent i think she also wanted to use the piece as a way to talk about different expressions of women who are trying to gain agency inside of systems households relationships that aren t built for them changing the gender of that character gives a space where you can do that you have hedda you have lovborg and you have lovborg s companion and collaborator thea these three very different women that are all contending with the same thing in diametrically opposed ways the film also moves the setting from 19th century norwegian drawing rooms to a wild dinner party at a country estate in postwar england which opens up a lot of possibilities for me it felt like the perfect period because the things that we believed and felt and the way we oriented ourselves in the 1950s that s our recent history and it still permeates culture to a certain extent right now you see a resurgence of so many of those ideas globally but particularly in this country it s also lush and fantastic and there s a certain kind of decadence to hedda in general that that time gives us in spades but it has to have some architecture you have to understand what she s wrestling against and certainly in ibsen s time she was such a provocative character because she was so different than the victorian ideal and then the hedda in our rendering also has all the societal pressures of the time of her gender of her race that creates this kind of pressure cooker how did you and nia want to handle race here with all those other elements in play we felt like it needed to be a texture because it would have been at that time and also because hedda herself is a woman who has a preoccupation with status i think there s a different landscape in the u k that is more about class than it is about race and yet it s kind of still about race you know but we didn t want the hat of the piece to be hung too squarely on that and you also don t want it to be a hat on a hat on a hat we were more interested in all the murky messy things that hedda s wrestling with as a woman nevermind race or any of the other trappings that can sometimes hem us in or define us this is perhaps the hottest hedda to date a lot of sexy things happen at that house party i ve seen so many versions of the play that still felt kind of wrapped in clich like jorgen hedda s husband played in the film by the british actor tom bateman as this sort of sniffly guy there s one version i saw where he was always blowing his nose and we were like what if he s hot actually maybe it s interesting that they have this sort of sexless potentially loveless marriage but he s actually attractive do you have a favorite stage hedda i really loved fiona shaw s it just felt so different tonally than what i had seen before and so personal like a woman who was responding in real time to things as opposed to someone that had this sort of master plan or was an expert manipulator and cate blanchett brought an incredible amount of humor and irony to hedda that was really delightful in ibsen s script hedda is 29 but ingrid bergman for one was 47 when she played her do you find that your perspective on the character has shifted since you first encountered her as a teenager approaching the part as a woman of my age now i think i really understand what it is to contend with a lifetime of choices and i have a clear understanding of what it may feel like to wake up one day in a life that really you don t want that you chose for a combination of reasons that made sense at the time and maybe don t anymore also the societal expectation to bear children and what that feels like in your body this sense of dread if you re wrong about not doing it i think that s something that you only understand as a woman of a certain age who does not have a child something that i also know nia was intensely interested in was just female rage and the longer that you spend as a woman you amass a lifetime of things that you are probably very angry about and have not had the ability to be honest with yourself about it i think it s one of the joys of hedda and maybe one of the reasons so many women want to play her is to allow unabashed access to that classical theater is a pretty rarefied medium who do you hope your hedda reaches as universal as some of these plays are i think there s been a kind of exclusionary way that they ve been presented and an idea of who they re for when i went to see a doll s house recently there weren t a ton of people in the crowd that looked like me there are probably some women sitting at home that this might speak to for a variety of reasons a lot of housewives that are popping on amazon prime so i m interested in them hey baby how are you doing laughs
moments into a friday morning news conference announcing the apprehension of a suspect in charlie kirk s killing the governor of utah spencer cox began to read aloud the phrases reportedly engraved on the assassin s bullet casings notices bulges owo what s this hey fascist catch oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao if you read this you are gay lmao these cryptic words were read tentatively by mr cox who seemed to have little idea of their meaning and provided no further context the governor also relayed how the suspect tyler robinson 22 communicated his actions to friends on the discord group chat platform one relative mr cox said described mr robinson as full of hate the only thing that can be said conclusively about mr robinson at this moment is that he was a chronically online white american male the internet s political communities and the open source sleuths currently scrambling to place mr robinson into a coherent ideological camp certainly won t be content with any of this nor will they be satisfied with the other likelihood awaiting us that mr robinson the son of a seemingly content mormon family probably possesses a mishmash of ideological stances some held dearly others not so much they also will not be satisfied that this horrific society changing act of violence was most likely committed both as an ironic gesture and as a pure political statement if your head is spinning from the internet s attempts to read into mr robinson s alleged choices and political identity that s understandable we ve fully stepped into a different historical moment the age of brain poisoning meme politics despite mounting evidence that the toxic energies of the internet have begun to spill over into our real lives there has been a reluctance to take the things happening online very seriously the revolting death spectacle that took place at utah valley university is a new kind of political event while the internet s rot once felt safely bottled or fire walled within a digital realm this act of political violence may have punctured whatever barrier once existed we can no longer ignore that we live in an era where the online and the lived are indistinguishable today s internet for most americans but especially for those like mr robinson who came of age on social and streaming platforms is an immeasurably potent vibes machine one powered by a complex fuel of negative emotions hatred rage hopelessness nihilism grievance cynicism paranoia discontent and addiction it s a machine more than capable of constructing false realities and corroding our lived experiences intent meaning and sincerity are near valueless concepts in this realm while things like knowledge understanding and good faith critical elements to any healthy public sphere have been gradually distorted beyond the point of recognition or abandoned completely to exist in this machine is to exist in a realm dominated by what the writer anton j ger termed hyperpolitics for the low cost low entry politics with little ties to political institutions or clear political outcomes to be a young person on large areas of the internet in other words is to exist in a state of perpetual conflict where every action every event is coded with political significance couched in irony or presented in a combative posture starting from the moment one goes online it s rapidly driving a generation mad and the rest of us as well governor cox made a blunt declaration at friday s press conference social media is a cancer on our society he said go outside and touch grass the beliefs flourishing in these online political spaces are fringe ideas from conspiratorial thinking about the 2020 election paranoia about white replacement the glorification of political violence and moral panics built on stereotypes about minority groups and they are fed to people on an algorithmically driven conveyor belt in the form of grotesque memes viral streams images of death and destruction ironic posturing and trolling it s likely that the influence of this machine and its ability to drive young people to the radical fringes would be diminished if american life today wasn t governed by a sense of chaos and collapse economic insecurity increasing unemployment the inability to start families or buy homes coupled with a livestreamed parade of death emanating from gaza and the trump administration s deployment of the national guard into american cities are just a few obvious factors driving these feelings figures like mr kirk along with other right wing influencers including ben shapiro laura loomer and the white nationalist nick fuentes have thrived in this new landscape they ve used the internet s reactionary machinery to great profit building mass followings and influence in the process mr kirk who had one of its loudest and most recognizable voices was an avatar of the new political species moving through this machine a type of political entity combining elements of celebrity demagogue shock jock thought leader content creator and activist turning point usa the campus activism group he co founded operated less like an organized political movement and more like a curious followership or fandom the message propagated by mr kirk in his regular livestreams and during his famous campus debates has been strangely labeled moderate in the immediate aftermath of his death conservative media and traditional outlets alike have celebrated his reputation for a willingness to foster open dialogues and the exchange of free ideas this characterization is out of step with the reality of mr kirk s activism which was defined by a pugilistic bigotry and dehumanizing political rhetoric he warned white americans to be on the lookout for prowling blacks and described george floyd as a scumbag he promoted the great replacement theory accused jewish philanthropists of funding anti whiteness and claimed that if president trump lost the 2024 election alabama would be overrun by hundreds of thousands of haitians a young internet user following just mr kirk could offer a fairly accurate glimpse into the atmosphere of perpetual rage baiting that is today s internet mr kirk lived to pick apart cotton mouthed college freshmen at his signature campus debate events each noted on his social channels with some belligerent title charlie kirk crushes woke lies charlie kirk hands out huge ls charlie kirk vs the washington state woke mob and regularly he lashed out at his perceived political foes like zohran mamdani the new york mayoral candidate whom he recently described as a self righteous narcissistic parasite who should be expelled from politics to be clear mr kirk s ideas however distasteful and problematic are no justification for murder what s apparent looking back on his ideas and the style in which he expressed them is that mr kirk used his platform to coarsen our political discourse draining it of that vital bulwark against real world violence empathy while much has been made of his ability to connect with gen z there has been little effort to hold his legacy to account for failing to impart this critical human quality to his young audiences the youth whisperer of the american right as this paper once called him may have been precisely that a showman who attracted disaffected young americans into the conservative movement with fantasies of white replacement or racial grievance the combative and rage bait style that mr kirk pioneered has become the dominant mode for the right and it s probably more accurate to say this is how many young americans as a whole exist on the internet today trolling and provoking anyone who crosses their paths back in july in an essay about the trolling style of politics infecting conservatism i wrote that conflict itself is the high voltage current that powers online engagement and amplifies messages mr kirk was a master architect of political conflict engineered for maximum reach that his killer might have been in pursuit of a similar moment of viral conflict is a grim encapsulation of the nightmare cesspit we ve entered the internet machine is now operating out in the open in front of everyone s eyes and as long as that continues unchecked our ability to make meaning of the world will continue to deteriorate empathy as a human quality will be snuffed out for those who are chronically online the memes and the memetic violence will continue to proliferate nathan taylor pemberton writes about extremism and american politics the times is

when i was a child my mother would take me to bathe in a spring near my village by the water there were palm trees and in them papanes birds found in the lush forests of the gulf coast in the mexican state of veracruz where i live they would break into song as we d approach the spring and other animals would flee my town escol n is an indigenous community that sits between papantla a tourist city named for the birds and poza rica an oil town whose name means rich well many of the wells that supply oil to poza rica are near escol n when the sun goes down nearby gas flares paint the night red i was born under these blood tinted skies they always seemed natural to me but i ve wondered what my forebears must have thought the first time the night sky turned red when commercial oil extraction began in the area over a century ago maybe that hell was coming out of the earth in 1928 the shell owned company el guila struck oil just west of poza rica the first major oil discovery in the indigenous region of totonacapan which spans the states of veracruz and puebla so began for my people the white man s exploitation of ixchalatiyat totonac for the oil extracted from the heart of the earth in the decades that followed the region was invaded peasants had gained rights to use land as members of ejidos or communal farms in the aftermath of the mexican revolution of 1910 to 1920 but amid growing interest in the area s oil deposits pemex the state owned oil and gas company snatched much of the territory by expropriating swaths of forest under federal law outsiders did other things to extinguish our relationship with our land too government run schools stigmatized the totonac language encouraging us to speak spanish instead christian missionaries quashed our traditional beliefs suggesting that the earth was a resource to be exploited all that remained of our cosmogony were stories tales told to scare children but plundered of the deep beliefs that gave meaning to our ties with the earth all the while heavy machinery made its way through the mountains razing vanilla plants and orange groves pemex began sending more and more workers to develop new wells by night flames would pulse between the trees by the 2010s ecological destruction had become the norm the soil bled around the town residents would leave home and find oil gushing from fractures in the earth oil would soak through the ground poisoning our water our fruit trees the soil in which we would plant corn animals disappeared fleeing noise and pollution we stopped being surprised the message from the government seemed to be this is the modern world get used to it in 2017 a pipeline exploded just outside escol n we woke up to the sound and rose to the glow of the forest on fire when it happened again in 2022 pemex personnel reportedly told inhabitants to leave the town it s possible that there will be more explosions they stated according to the national indigenous congress and we don t take responsibility for the lives of any residents who chose to remain the earth wasn t just weeping fire gas and oil it was leaking poison prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons has been linked to respiratory issues birth defects and higher rates of cancer in the town of emiliano zapata one of the most polluted communities in totonacapan where two of the area s streams are black with toxic sludge and the streets reek of oil and gas residents fear for their health indigenous people across totonacapan haven t just suffered from the destruction of our land in the face of escalating cartel violence we have also been harassed and detained persecuted abused and increasingly killed i began organizing my community in 2013 after a federal energy reform opened the oil industry to private investment accelerating foreign companies entry into the region working with other activists i became involved in the fight for indigenous sovereignty a multipronged struggle against environmental destruction economic marginalization and organized crime i saw how in areas where pemex had a bigger presence cartel cells appeared and people were murdered and disappeared almost at random violence took hold in totonacapan years before as the state went to war with the cartels and the cartels went to war with one another leaving innocent civilians caught in the crossfire but this was different cartels have profited enormously from fuel theft across mexico in areas like papantla which are dense with oil wells and refineries cartels come to tap pemex owned pipelines and resell the fuel on the black market a practice so common it has its own slang term huachicol in my town we felt the difference as organized crime moved in to make a profit off the contraband fuel cartel safe houses appeared in the mountains operation centers with telecommunication antennas and advanced infrastructure armed men in civilian clothes patrolled roads leading to oil wells businesses closed more lifeless bodies began to appear near the highway that connects papantla and poza rica especially by the section known as the devil s curve only half a mile from escol n in the fall of 2016 authorities found the corpses of two priests who were dragged out of a church at gunpoint the day before violence does not discriminate farmers found bodies in their fields there were curfews people stopped going out after dark many locals were forcibly removed from their land or simply chose to leave when a family member was disappeared and more and more people vanished in the late 2010s a collective of family members of the disappeared contacted residents in escol n the relatives wanted to search for their loved ones under the earth of our town i began accompanying them this group of more than 200 parents searching for their lost children i became close friends with a man named magdaleno p rez santes whose daughter diana paloma disappeared not far from my home in 2019 then on a sunday in the spring maleno as he was known to us was detained by the municipal police before a scheduled effort to locate her upon his release a day later he showed signs of having been brutally beaten he died of his injuries shortly after that the search collective has located numerous extermination sites in totonacapan places used by the cartels to incinerate the remains of their victims one day i took an indigenous ritualist to one of these sites it was a ranch in the middle of the jungle known as la gallera where a large pile of human ash and skeletal remains had been found inside a bread oven when he arrived he spoke of how the mothers of the disappeared had cursed the forest because they saw it as the place where their children were taken to be tortured burned and erased from the world as he performed a ritual to purify the space he remarked that the land was both a victim and a survivor of this violence today across totonacapan oil has become synonymous with ecological destruction cartel violence and political disenfranchisement the government promotes mexico s indigenous population for tourist or public relations purposes but has not done enough to help those of us whose hometowns are flooded with oil or besieged by organized crime in a bid to revitalize pemex which is deeply in debt president claudia sheinbaum is looking to expand the use of fracking a highly destructive practice that involves fracturing bedrock deep in the earth in areas like mine against all odds people in my town and other indigenous communities across mexico continue moving walking the paths of resistance that our ancestors opened with great effort i still find cause for hope when i see women organizing together communities defending their territory parents searching for their children we have no choice but to fight because it is a fight for our survival but it is not easy eventually the spring where i used to bathe dried up small pipelines had been installed around the town draining water away from us those springs had been our sources of water for generations and some people in escol n tapped the pipes to steal back what had been theirs the water that came out was different it was tinted yellow and smelled of gas some hired a truck to deliver clean water for fear of contamination many of us though had no choice we drank the foul liquid anyway omar l zaro garc a is an environmental and human

on sunday voters in hundreds of cities towns and villages across germany s most populous state will choose their next local officials although the elections in north rhine westphalia have no direct effect on national politics many in germany are watching them as a measure of the country s mood they are the first electoral test for the christian democratic union party of chancellor friedrich merz since he assumed office in may since mr merz won the national election in february the far right alternative for germany party or afd has continued to surge in popularity with polls showing that a quarter of voters back it the afd which germany s domestic intelligence service has designated an extremist party is now neck and neck with mr merz and his conservative alliance which won 28 5 percent of the vote but whose support has fallen to 26 percent according to polls the center left social democrats who are the junior partner in mr merz s government coalition are faring even worse here is what to know about the vote on sunday polls for the races in north rhine westphalia either do not exist or are unreliable so it will became clear only after ballots are counted on sunday night whether mr merz s governing coalition in berlin has hurt or helped the christian democratic union in the state elections the party traditionally performs well in rural areas small towns and villages but support in these areas is mostly based on the records of local politicians meaning that mr merz s policies such as trying to curb migration reboot the economy or rebuild the army could be less important to voters for the social democrats sunday s elections could hurt many of the regions s blue collar workers the traditional base of the party are expected to turn to the afd which has attracted them in other states a major loss of support from its core voters in a former heartland would be a serious setback for the party this is the biggest question some analysts and politicians have raised the possibility of a far right sweep in the industrial heartland of the state where unemployment and dissatisfaction with federal politics are high while the afd s appeal has been growing across the country the party has not been able to establish itself in any city government in what used to be west germany a victory would be major milestone the afd benefits from the weakness of the spd said andreas bl tte a political scientist at the university duisburg essen in the state referring to the social democrats professor bl tte added that the afd could win in traditionally working class areas and warned that even if their victories were isolated to just a few cities it would be a shock for the mainstream political parties gelsenkirchen a city in north rhine westphalia that used to be a center of heavy industry and coal mining is one of the places where the afd is expected to do well analysts say and the party could even win the mayoralty during the national election the afd won 25 percent of the vote in the city 7 percentage points more than the party scored across western germany the city has high unemployment and poverty and a big immigrant community many voters there are fed up with the social democrats which have been running gelsenkirchen for the past 15 years i could see given the mood and the fact that people are ready to teach someone a lesson that the afd could do quite well said j rg pfnister who runs a small wine bar at an outdoor market where locals meet every wednesday evening mr pfnister who used to work at the nearby opel car factory said he saw the downtown dying out as people forgo the more expensive shopping there for discount or migrant run supermarkets at city s peripheries norbert emmerich a financial adviser and a member of the city council who is the afd s candidate for mayor was guarded when asked about his chances he said he expected between a quarter and a third of the vote a long way from the 50 percent needed to win however given that there are nearly a dozen contenders for the mayor many predict a runoff between the top two parties a second round of voting would be held on sept 28

appearance he became an object of fascination among musicians a phenomenon that continued until the end of his life his songs of which there seemed to be an endless stream were recorded by cannonball adderley gil evans john mclaughlin charlie haden and others later in mr pascoal s career the kronos quartet commissioned him to write a piece for them marcando tempo marking time which became a regular part of their repertoire by the mid 1970s mr pascoal had a firmly established reputation in the jazz world as both a talented musician and an amiable oddball davis affectionately referred to him as that crazy albino and in downbeat magazine the critic howard mandel compared him to two other notable eccentrics writing that he was as pan global a leader as sun ra and as sure footed an individualist as rahsaan roland kirk though mr pascoal continued to tour in the united states and europe he went back to brazil to live and thanks to his international reputation for the first time was able to form a permanent band of his own commercial engagements at home were few but his rehearsals became famous for their rigor and mr pascoal and his band made numerous records in an idiom that was primarily jazz but also included elements of bossa nova and brazilian folk music as a more prosperous brazil became a popular touring stop for foreign musicians those visitors among them stan getz dizzy gillespie and chick corea would invite mr pascoal to join them onstage when they performed in rio or s o paulo at the same time a younger generation of musicians in the united states and europe sought out mr pascoal s early recordings and talked him up in music publications in 1997 mr pascoal embarked on a whimsical project writing one song a day for an entire year beginning on his birthday so that everyone could have a personalized birthday song the songs were never officially released on cd but his notated calendar of sound was eventually published in book form and has become a collector s item among musicians mr pascoal s wife of 46 years the former ilza da silva died in 2000 at a performance in october 2002 in londrina brazil he met aline paula nilson a singer and dancer known professionally as aline morena who became his companion and prompted him to leave rio and move to curitiba her hometown in southern brazil the instrument i like most is whatever instrument i happen to be playing at the moment mr pascoal said in an interview with the new york times in 2004 and he added since everything is an instrument from the burble of water to a symphony orchestra there is never a moment i am without music
s ophie ellis bextor swoops into the restaurant looking so sophie ellis bextor so disco diva that it almost makes me laugh she is wearing a gold trimmed blusher pink kaftan style caped dress and has a wide smudge of neon blue eyeshadow streaked across her eyelids she could have freshly twirled off the dancefloor at studio 54 it is a strong look for a late afternoon chat in a quiet hotel but then i remember that she has been at a photoshoot all day and assume she must still be wearing one of the outfits these are my own clothes she says as if that should have been perfectly obvious the guardian s journalism is independent we will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link learn more to be fair ellis bextor is throwing a party later so she has made an effort she s hosting a playback of her new album perimenopop which is also very disco so much so that chic s nile rodgers is on one of the tracks during the covid lockdowns in 2020 the pop star hosted a weekly kitchen disco broadcast live on instagram from her family home with her husband the musician richard jones and with occasional cameos from her five sons people must think she s pretty good at throwing a party well i am capable she says drily there will be a photo booth aptly the bar already has a giant glitter ball hanging from the ceiling as a title perimenopop is both silly and defiant it came from a joke in the studio between ellis bextor and her friend hannah robinson who co writes some of her songs we re a similar age she says and so we were jokingly saying oh it s perimenopop and we thought it was hilarious it just didn t leave my head it s a showy attention grabbing name i think i m in my sod it era really what s the point of tiptoeing around she is 46 now as she gets older she is growing much more comfortable in her own skin just shaking off a lot of the peripheral worries of stuff she says she started planning her return to dance music in 2021 having been reminded by the lockdown kitchen discos just how much music and dancing can lift the spirits music is often a cape that i will shroud myself in to boost me up a bit she says she wrote perimenopop wall to wall bangers mostly about enjoying life at home in comfort working in the daytime eating dinner with her family at night i stretched myself out like a cat letting the music lift me and letting it make me feel better perimenopop arrives at a time when perimenopause is slowly becoming part of the cultural landscape from bridget christie s underrated channel 4 comedy the change to miranda july s literary juggernaut all fours i do feel so grateful to all of the women who have made it more of a conversation she says i was working with someone the other day just met her and she was like oh i m having a hot flush perimenopause once that was a conversation ellis bextor thinks she might have had with her mum but not with her friends now there s much more transparency thank goodness there s just so much less mystery and more help for people who need it and what about her own experience of it it s funny because when i said to my mum about the album she said you do realise in interviews that they re going to ask you about it she laughs i feel like i m just on the cusp of it really maybe in the first room i don t know how many rooms there are but it s chats that my girlfriends and i have been having many of her friends are women she has known since they were at school together and they are coming to the party tonight in a lot of ways ellis bextor is overdue a celebration she has been a household name since the turn of the century when an early career as an indie singer collapsed and led her inadvertently to the housey pop of the song groovejet if this ain t love which became an international hit for years alongside music she has done the celebrity circuit appearing on the likes of strictly come dancing and the masked singer she has a podcast spinning plates in which she interviews mothers who also work when the bbc needed a new year s eve host as 2024 rolled into 2025 they got her to throw everyone a party she has become the nation s smart fun big sister but her music career has undergone a resurgence on a massive scale too it s not that she ever stopped making records perimenopop is her eighth studio album but in 2024 her other megahit murder on the dancefloor first released at the end of 2001 became one of the biggest pop songs in the world it had made a splashy appearance in the emerald fennell film saltburn soundtracking the now infamous scene in which barry keoghan s character dances through a country house nude as the day he was born ellis bextor saw saltburn and that scene for the first time at a private screening in london at 10am with a lot of her family in tow my oldest boy my mum my brother his then very new girlfriend my husband a friend had warned her that it was quite extreme i m like come on she laughs but yeah it was ellis bextor and jones were flown to la to dj at the premiere and afterwards a couple of her friends told her that she was on the verge of becoming a thing one of those things where the song goes everywhere and i was like i really don t think so let s not lose our heads but by the end of 2024 it had been everywhere becoming the biggest song of the year by a british female artist 20 years after it first came out it s hardly like you re at retirement age i say but still was the song s belated success surprising given that pop is so often characterised as a young person s game she politely rebuffs me part of what i loved about disco was that a lot of the vocalists were telling stories and singing songs from a point of experience ok they could be cautionary tales they could be stories that were the other side of heartache but they weren t all anchored in youth culture then there s social media her oldest son is 21 and tells her that on tiktok nobody cares about the age of the person singing the song or how old the song is if it means something true in the heat of the murder on the dancefloor revival last year was quite a giddy time of my life but ellis bextor has been a professional musician since she was 16 this year will be 30 years since my first gig she points out so the years are there and i m really into that i like experience a few years ago when she wrote her autobiography also called spinning plates she said that she was happier at 42 than she had ever been before how is it now at 46 same same that s nice she laughs i m very content with what i have in my life it s exciting when you have the twists in the road and new experiences but i am also very aware of how good i have it the main impression i got from the book and one not dimmed by meeting her in person is that ellis bextor is one of life s great optimists i am very optimistic she nods i am my mother s daughter her mother janet ellis was a blue peter presenter who turned to writing novels in her 60s ellis bextor had a short lived sideline in selling blue peter badges to her classmates when she was at primary school shh not so loud she jokes i haven t got any with me i m afraid she reconsiders the optimism question i m a pragmatic optimist she says i m happy to acknowledge and explore things that upset me or that hurt but i m quite good at framing things in a way that can make me feel good about stuff ultimately her music career now spanning four decades involves quite a lot of pragmatic optimism i don t want to say that she has been lucky there s definitely been a lot of luck she interrupts cheerfully but there is a sense that a lot of things happened to her as if by chance oh 100 serendipity but i suppose the trick is to be able to get the most out of these opportunities when they come your way as a teenager growing up in west london ellis bextor thought she wanted to act but music was her real love she bought the nme and melody maker every week and was obsessed with britpop at 16 she started going to an indie night in london called popscene living for the weekend as she puts it in her rimmel black cherries lipstick a 1995 staple one night she met a journalist from melody maker who passed her a note with a phone number on it and told her that his mate was looking for a singer she recorded a tape of herself singing oasis covers and handed it over the next night that band was called theaudience for a brief moment they were music press darlings it must have given her whiplash to go from reading melody maker to being on the cover of it it was terrifying ellis bextor says now it was a baptism of fire and i was a closet square really i felt like oh my god i m not cool i can t keep up i don t fit in and of course it turned out everybody was feeling a bit like that theaudience had a moment did ok but they were signed to a major label and ok wasn t enough they were dropped after their debut album and the music press turned on them it is hard to avoid the suspicion that she is part of some sly television expos on how to get ahead in the music industry read one of the more vicious gig reviews from that time it s hard because you re reading all the stuff about you that you re worried is how people think about you so she laughs as a teenage girl it s not ideal but of course she has found the positives the good news is it definitely built up a kind of resilience when theaudience got dropped she thought it was all over i was like oh my god i ve already had the highest high already and i m not even 20 now for the rest of my life i m going to be this tragic person who ll say i had a record deal once when i was 18 why did she feel she could plough on when others might have walked away i just didn t have anything else i felt i could do she shrugs then serendipity intervened once again she recorded a speculative vocal for a dance track that turned into spiller s groovejet if this ain t love even though she kept saying that she didn t like dance music i was just a proper indie kid she protests obviously she loves it now i remember thinking melody maker and nme won t even know i ve done this and then they won t be bruising me because it s a whole different world sign up to inside saturday the only way to get a look behind the scenes of the saturday magazine sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must read articles and columns delivered to your inbox every weekend after newsletter promotion groovejet was a massive international hit at the exact moment she had stopped trying to be credible and then once i stopped trying it was like oh i m up and running she still works with a lot of the people she met at that time i ve always been quite good at recognising good folk but i think also because i d had the failure with the band i was probably just a little bit less of a brat than i might have been she met her husband when they were both 22 jones was auditioning for her band he would go on to form the feeling and when he joined her on the road they became firm friends both were in other relationships at the time but after a while their mutual attraction was obvious they celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary in june they had only been seeing each other for a few weeks when ellis bextor discovered she was pregnant her first solo album had just come out and she had become a target for the tabloids that whole time was freaky she says because when she was in theaudience nobody ever really knew who she was then all of a sudden after groovejet she would be recognised in the street and that was simultaneous with phone hacking so i just thought that being known in that era meant that you didn t have any ownership over information it just was so normal to me before she had told her friends that she was pregnant her press officer called her to ask if it was true and to let her know that the papers were running the story the next day at the time she brushed off the tabloid intrusion i just thought that was what happened but now i m like god that is outrageous for a moment she looks almost appalled their relationship was so new that they hadn t yet said i love you they didn t move in with each other until two weeks before sonny was born but still she finds a silver lining it s ok i was just starting out with richard i was falling in love with him so there s lots of reasons to be cheerful but i do look back and think it s pretty outrageous really she only learned that she had been a victim of phone hacking many years later when the police got in touch to let her know for a long time she let it lie i thought i don t want to dredge up any negativity i m happy i ve got my young family i don t need to dwell on something but eventually she pursued and received a settlement from the mirror group i did actually want to be a tiny little thorn in their side even if only for a split second i was happy being a little tiny teeny pest even if that s all i ve got she doesn t remember the details she adds because she was having a baby at the time who s now 13 so it s quite a while ago she pauses i think it was that baby i laugh sorry i was definitely having a baby and i m pretty sure it was him after all she has had five of them she starts to giggle sometimes i ve got baby pictures and i don t know which one it is i don t remember whose first word was what her youngest is six her eldest 21 i ask if that means she s really good at it now a well oiled machine i don t know about that because they re all individuals they ve all got a slightly different relationship with me i don t think it s like now i present you with mother 5 0 people are often fascinated by the fact that she has five boys during her fourth and fifth pregnancies strangers would tell her that she must be wishing for a girl sometimes you d get some bore sat next to you at one of those dinners where you don t know them and they d be like oh how terrible you have sons i just think people have got quite narrow ideas sometimes she is careful to point out that she doesn t actually consider this to be a big issue this is small fry really it s more an occasional lack of imagination than an everyday problem somehow in her lightness she manages to sound even more scathing but in the current climate there has been an increasing interest in what it s like to raise boys it s definitely become more of a topic recently she says but she shuts it down before it can get going it s a bit clickbaity isn t it it only makes me feel sad because my children are five really interesting lovely people and i don t really like the idea of their imagined characters being skewed into something for that one of the things she has learned from doing her podcast in which she has long conversations with other mothers is how to talk about her job with her children i don t diminish it any more i used to be very apologetic about work i d make it tiny she puts on a quiet squeaky voice i ve got to go and do this thing i wish i didn t have to i ll be as quick as i can i d rather be here that just isn t the truth she loves what she does and after the lockdowns especially she realised how much she needs to perform to feel like herself now when she goes somewhere she talks about it differently i say to the kids this matters to me i like what i do don t worry i ll be back soon but i ve worked really hard to get these opportunities that kind of thing so i think i frame it better in 2013 ellis bextor appeared on strictly come dancing getting through to the final week in her book she was candid about the strain that it put on her relationship with jones he gave her permission to write about the fact that he sought counselling when she was on the show to help him cope with anxiety it triggered about their relationship i thought that was really brave of him she says but look it wasn t like he thought i was going to run off it was more than 10 years ago she points out a little wearily but he felt like it wasn t involving him and then because he was seeing us experiencing things separately it shook something he was worried about it every time they went out she said people would joke about the so called curse of strictly in which the celebrities and their dance partners supposedly fall for each other and i think it just started to wear him down a little bit jones worked through it and was supportive of her time on the show but ellis bextor was an early critic of some aspects of strictly writing about how she felt the contestants were not always well supported psychologically is it fair to say that she wasn t surprised when allegations of unacceptable behaviour emerged in 2024 i only know what i witnessed on my year she says i made some really good friends out of it and i loved doing the dancing but i think they should have been checking in because i was seeing real relationships changing and people breaking up the programme should have taken that more seriously she thinks she calls it an extraordinary heady chapter i think maybe some of the things i spoke about in the book aren t seen as exotic any more because more people have contributed to talking about the things i experienced she wrote that at times doing the show was too intimate too intense and that contestants were back then at least separated from family and friends she practically pinpointed what the show needed to change long before they agreed to change it i suggest and they ve done it all good chapter closed she says sunnily ellis bextor has work to do she is about to swoop off again to get ready for her perimenopop party and before the guests arrive she has to record some clips for instagram twirling around in the pink dress lip syncing to her new single she mentions a conversation that she had recently with a man who is 20 years older than her who suggested she take all of august off as she s had such a busy year she asked him how he had felt in his 40s and he told her that he had felt driven and i said that s where i m at i think that s not always expected in some ways i think i m better at being in my 40s than in my 20s i wonder what the difference is i think you ve curated your life a little bit more you re not trying things out for the first time but doing the things that you know work for you what s next then i say menopop she laughs oh my god imagine i m already getting so many people contacting me saying i run this menopause help thing but she gets serious for a minute what s next i don t know but i don t think you should do what i do if you like knowing what happens next this from the woman whose 20 year old song has just been a huge global hit again yeah she says smiling that doesn t work perimenopop is out now
i t is too easy to blame donald trump for everything that goes wrong in the world the ability of any us president to fundamentally change or control the behaviour of other major powers is frequently overestimated yet by posing as a sort of uncrowned global monarch and grand arbiter of war and peace trump perpetuates fantasies of us hegemony omnipotence and divine right intoxicated by such ego inflating delusions he pledged before taking office to swiftly end the ukraine and gaza conflicts perhaps in his vanity and hubris he truly believed he could eight months on the exact opposite is happening both crises are expanding and escalating the bubble has burst his bluff has been called the emperor has no clothes and there is no denying that trump by alternately appeasing excusing and encouraging the two foremost villains of these twin tragedies is greatly to blame last week s multiple russian drone incursions into nato member poland which polish officials are right to call deliberate risk transforming the ukraine war into a europe wide conflagration likewise the reckless illegal israeli airstrike in qatar which blew up the gaza peace process physically and metaphorically has supercharged regional tensions a common factor in both developments is us weakness which is to say trump weakness has any other us president devoted so much effort to making himself look like a strong leader while failing miserably to act like one when it matters much of what he does whether it s promulgating illegal executive orders firing senior officials bullying neighbours and defenceless migrants ordering troops on to the streets of us cities backing a fellow coup leader in brazil or picking fights with judges and independent media is about bolstering the strongman trump image the reality is very different when trump is faced by tough unyielding opponents rather than soft targets he folds he chickens out russia s president vladimir putin and israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu worked this out long ago both men play him for a sucker they flatter him they spin lies about wanting peace they offer easy wins then they go home as was the case with putin after last month s embarrassing alaska summit and carry on doing whatever they want which usually involves even greater violence when an angry trump calls to complain as after netanyahu s qatar raid and whinges pathetically that he s not happy he merely confirms his weakness and is ignored far from facilitating an end to these wars trump has become a prime obstacle to peace his ill considered interventions grandstanding and partiality make matters worse prolonging both conflicts his dearth of leadership skills coupled with a lack of integrity and common sense is shocking for europeans accustomed to dealing with mostly rational relatively competent presidents trump s hostility to the eu and nato his tariff wars and his anti democratic machinations have further undermined western cohesion and confidence and boosted authoritarian regimes watching from his kremlin lair putin acts accordingly the drone incursion into poland not the first but by far the biggest was a calculated test of nato reactions and unity he will have been gratified by the defensive vulnerabilities it exposed and the uneven political response trump has said little so far and done nothing his silence is telling he will not admit that his fawning subservience towards putin has backfired horribly nor despite the many military diplomatic and economic weapons at his disposal will he now summon the strength and courage to take a stand so putin gets a free pass again next time it could be worse what if say russia directly threatens finland or germany what will trump do then on the evidence to date the suspicion is not much former president joe biden was rightly criticised for playing it cautious on ukraine trump is barely in the game the uk and european nato states must stop deferring to washington take off the gloves and finally draw a line with moscow creating a protected no fly zone over unoccupied areas of ukraine expanding military aid halting all russian energy imports confiscating frozen kremlin funds isolating sanctions busting russian and chinese banks and downgrading or cutting diplomatic ties with putin s regime are courses of action repeatedly urged here and if need be europe s armies must be prepared to shoot back waiting for trump is as futile as waiting for godot without the jokes sign up to matters of opinion guardian columnists and writers on what they ve been debating thinking about reading and more after newsletter promotion arab leaders meeting this weekend face similar pressure to break with the us after sidelined trump sat back while netanyahu added qatar a us ally to the long list of countries israel has attacked with us supplied planes and bombs since 7 october 2023 what price now his grandiose plan to remake the middle east us policy is held hostage to netanyahu s extremist nihilism cut off us weapons supplies to israel freeze bilateral financial aid impose sanctions support war crimes prosecutions of israeli leaders recognise an independent state of palestine any normal american president might do some or all of this but trump isn t normal he s an aberration he s out of his depth historic failures of international leadership are becoming all too common in this fractured 21st century world one was the 2003 us british decision to invade iraq another is the failure to effectively address the climate emergency now two more comparably epic disasters simultaneously loom if the un holding its annual get together this month if europe if the west allow russia and israel to pursue their murderous illegal immoral and ever expanding aggression there may be no stopping an accelerating descent into global anarchy unless democratic countries unite to secure a rapid halt to these wars employing all necessary means including military force then greater calamities will surely follow but don t count on the us to take the lead don t count on weakling trump he s part of the problem he s frit simon

my daughter aged nearly 50 lives in a pleasant cul de sac of privately owned houses her front garden is the only one in it that frankly looks a mess the grass is never cut because she says it s eco frien dly and has wild flowers mainly dandelions and three prized wild orchids it s a very small garden and is crammed with untended bushes fruit trees and a central tree that takes all the light from her sitting room recently she s been given five large fruit bushes in pots which straggle over the path i would be very disappointed if i had such an eyesore next door to me she s a single mum with two sons who have recently left school but she won t let them tidy up her garden we live three hours away but always feel ashamed when we visit and push our way up the overgrown path does it matter or are we just pernickety old folk with outdated views i d appreciate another opinion i think you ll get a lot of other opinions below this column whenever someone says or does something that on the face of it seems unhelpful i always think what is the motivation here and i do believe your motivation is one of caring for your daughter maybe it s easier to say you re worried about her by focusing those worries horticulturally but there are a fair number of loaded words in your letter privately owned the only one prized disappointed single mum ashamed i wonder if your daughter feels this judgment too what are you really worried about what s her house like how does she run her life are her sons your grandsons well cared for i ask not to heap more judgment on to her or you but to see if she is depressed or needs help or whether this really is just about a messy garden your daughter is right that gardens can be a wildlife haven and of course if it works for her then it works uk registered psychotherapist katherine cavallo wondered if there were different generational meanings attached to the garden to you a well kept garden may be a sign of being a respectful neighbour or even an indicator of success and social standing in the local community however it sounds as though your daughter sees things differently her garden may be a means of expressing her values identity or political views she may feel she is consciously doing her part to protect the planet by creating a place for biodiversity as a lone parent her garden may not be a top priority and she may have limited resources to devote to it i think the word priority is key here what matters to you it may not matter so much to her and vice versa if your grandsons have left school they may soon be leaving home and cavallo wonders if your concern which may be felt as criticism and could result in your daughter withdrawing further from you could instead be turned into openness and curiosity to generate a different pattern of communication one where your daughter may feel more able to voice her feelings as she approaches a transition in her life with her children on the point of leaving home or at least a next stage what are her hopes and dreams for the independence this will bring her and how will her garden fit into this if she were able to enjoy the space more what might that look like curiosity is always a better key into places than criticism i m going to suggest a little exercise that helps me and may help you to work out what this is really about i call it corkscrewing you think of what s causing you angst then you corkscrew down to try to work out what it s really about at each stage asking yourself about the feelings it brings up and what it makes you think about you then go further down into that emotion feeling and explore what else it brings up this takes time thought and reflection but you know when you ve got to the hot emotion what s really upsetting you because you either go that s it or it makes you upset sign up to inside saturday the only way to get a look behind the scenes of the saturday magazine sign up to get the inside story from our top writers as well as all the must read articles and columns delivered to your inbox every weekend after newsletter promotion maybe it really is just about the garden in which case you can let this go but my feeling is that it s about something else and only then can you see what really needs weeding out every week annalisa barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader if you would like advice from annalisa please send your problem to ask annalisa theguardian com annalisa regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence submissions are subject to our terms and conditions the latest series of annalisa s podcast is available here comments on this piece are pre moderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article please be aware that there may be a short delay in comments appearing on the site
boris johnson started the day with a jog he had the kind of schedule that would be familiar to any occupant of downing street from 8 44am he talked with his aides then chaired cabinet ate lunch prepped for prime minister s questions took a briefing on security threats and got ready for an interview with one of rupert murdoch s reporters the entry for 5 48pm in the official log for tuesday 26 april 2022 contains one of several privileged interactions that he would later seek to exploit for financial gain johnson was in his office the log notes alone texting mbs within two years johnson by then out of office would be trying to use the relationship he nurtured with saudi arabia s mohammed bin salman widely known by his initials as part of an intercontinental campaign of self enrichment those widespread commercial activities which raise questions about misuse of public funds and breaches of revolving door prohibitions on lobbying have been exposed this week by the guardian after a leak from johnson s private office the crown prince heir to a fossil fuel fortune that makes his family among the richest that has ever lived had established himself as the all powerful ruler of saudi arabia and a player on the global stage johnson had also spoken to prince mohammed on the phone for seven minutes shortly after 8pm the previous night according to the logs seen by the guardian they discussed international developments the war in ukraine and cooperation between their countries and ways to develop it six advisers had been with johnson on that call now it was just him and the crown prince texting the moment captures the intimacy that can be shared by fellow holders of high office two individuals with the power of nations at their disposal once their exchange was over johnson set off for an outing in the west end to catch six the musical with his wife carrie we do not know what the prime minister and the autocrat were messaging about although johnson has spoken fondly of a man he calls a changemaker what we do now know is the contents of a letter addressed to prince mohammed that johnson wrote two years later in march 2024 after the collapse of his prime ministership i remain a fervent admirer of the vision you have for the kingdom of saudi arabia a draft of the letter reads the text appears beneath the letterhead of the office of boris johnson the private office that is part subsidised by the taxpayer johnson explains that he has taken up a business venture i would very much like to explore whether that company could be useful to you and the kingdom of saudi arabia in achieving your ambitions because i believe it certainly could the letter is in a cache of leaked documents obtained by distributed denial of secrets a us non profit that archives data leaks the files shed new light on johnson s time in downing street from secret meetings with tech and media executives to yet more details of possible covid lockdown breaches but the revelations about his commercial activity and numerous apparent breaches of ethics rules could prove most difficult for johnson they tally with an apparent disdain for the ethical norms of public life observed by some of those who have worked with him at close quarters max hastings his editor at the daily telegraph in the 1980s has alleged johnson cares for no interest save his own fame and gratification his supporters might point out he is not the first former prime minister to be criticised for the way he has sought to cash in after his time in office it is perhaps telling that the others have also gone to the gulf in his memoir unleashed johnson writes tony blair once told me that mohammed bin salman the crown prince was the hope of the region and i can see why the saudi royal s admirers call him a reformer he is relaxing some of the most draconian restrictions on what women are permitted to do and opening the islamic kingdom to outsiders he has also proved a generous friend to veterans of downing street the tony blair institute receives saudi funding and was awarded a contract reportedly worth about 8m to support prince mohammed s agenda during david cameron s time as a hired lobbyist for the soon to be disgraced australian financier lex greensill the pair went camping with prince mohammed in the saudi desert both former pms maintained their saudi relationships after an incident in 2018 that critics said revealed the true face of the regime jamal khashoggi a dissident writer living in the us was lured to the saudi embassy in istanbul murdered and dismembered in 2021 us intelligence agencies concluded that prince mohammed approved the operation johnson in private at least appeared to have been fully aware of the gravity of the khashoggi episode in april 2023 a year on from the evening he sat texting the crown prince johnson was asked about khashoggi s assassination during a private event in north carolina according to a transcript in the leaked data johnson was by then out of downing street but still an mp he had already embarked on a global speaking tour that the leaked files show earned him more than 5m from 34 speeches from lagos to singapore he even provided the entertainment at a german businessman s 50th birthday party at the north carolina event his view of the khashoggi was unvarnished i think that first of all nobody should minimise what happened to jamal khashoggi i hope you heard me say that loud and clear i ve raised it with mbs as you d expect the killing of the journalist johnson said was clearly an unforgivable crime yet johnson would soon be telling the crown prince of his fervent admiration by the time johnson resigned as an mp he had already set up his private office like those of all former prime ministers johnson s office can claim an allowance from the taxpayer of up to 115 000 a year that money is strictly for use on public duties the leaked files raise questions about whether funds which are used to pay the salaries of staff in the offices of former pms were misused in pursuit of profit johnson s office employs three staff all three the leaked data suggests have been involved in commercial activity it is perhaps unsurprising that johnson would launch an intensive money making operation after the scandal over the downing street refurbishment complete with gold wallpaper one of johnson s no 10 aides was quoted as saying the bottom line is that he can t afford to be prime minister for one thing he has nine children to support and remunerative projects such as a long overdue book on shakespeare sometimes fail to materialise the leaked documents indicate that his part time role at a company called better earth would be worth 120 000 a year as well as an initial 12 5 stake in the business founded by a canadian mining investor better earth s shareholders include seven close associates and advisers to johnson including two former conservative ministers and an aide he made a peer it was for better earth that johnson penned the overtures to the saudi crown prince in march 2024 the pitch to assist with the greening of the foremost petrostate although i now live a life of blameless rustic obscurity in oxfordshire johnson wrote i remain deeply committed to carbon reduction it is not clear how the saudis responded or how much money johnson brought in but this was not the only time he sought to trade on relationships nurtured in no 10 as you know he wrote in a draft letter to seek business from another senior figure in the gulf he knew from his downing street years a key part of my legacy as prime minister of the united kingdom was coalescing world leaders around a series of concrete commitments at the cop26 climate summit in 2021 the files suggest johnson and an aide had been offered stakes potentially worth millions in a climate finance solutions venture part of his job was to lobby the abu dhabi official who controls one of the emirate s vast pots of oil wealth johnson s partners in the firm bia advisory wanted more than 1bn of abu dhabi s money to invest the leaked files suggest they did not respond to the guardian s questions about whether they got it but the documents appear to confirm that johnson lobbied the official khaldoon al mubarak best known in the uk as chair of manchester city for the first two years after they leave office former uk ministers are banned from using contacts gained in government for private benefit however johnson had hosted mubarak at least three times in downing street johnson also appears to have broken the same rule during his saudi venture the advisory committee on business appointments acoba is the revolving door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post government careers of ex ministers he sought acoba clearance for his role at better earth seemingly without disclosing the saudi angle acoba granted it but with conditions until he had been out of office for two years johnson should not become personally involved in lobbying contacts you developed during your time in office in other governments to seek business according to the leaked files he already had no such restrictions on turning power into money constrain the sheikhs the gulf is the one part of the world where kleptocracy is not just legal but positively encouraged said oliver bullough the author of butler to the world a book about how the uk serves the rich powerful and corrupt it s no wonder politicians flock there though it would be nice if they didn t at first when the guardian contacted him to ask about the apparent misconduct revealed in the leaked files johnson was silent after the first articles were published senior politicians said the government should suspend johnson s access to the public duty costs allowance pdca the funding intended to support an ex pm s public duties at that point johnson got in touch this story is rubbish he emailed the pdca has been used entirely in accordance with the rules he added the guardian should change its name to pravda but it is johnson s truthfulness that is not for the first time under scrutiny on 18 march 2024 the leaked files show johnson was sent a letter from acoba officials newspapers had revealed that a hedge fund manager took johnson with him to caracas to meet nicol s maduro the head of a venezuelan regime notorious for corruption and brutalising opponents the acoba officials wanted to know whether this might have breached their rules the meeting was unpaid johnson told them in his reply that seems to be contradicted by documents in the leaked files one is a contract with merlyn the hedge fund on whose behalf johnson met with maduro a leader he had once likened to a dictator of an evil regime another records johnson s office sending merlyn an invoice weeks before his letter to acoba for 240 000 rules such as acoba s have evolved as part of a system designed to preserve public faith that their elected representatives are acting in the

haul of silverware including seven premier league titles four fa cups and a champions league trophy his leadership and mentality were the very fabric of united s success during their period of dominance keane provided the psychological and emotional engine that drove a dynasty newcastle to manchester united 7m cole s transfer was met with immediate public scepticism owing to the nature of the move from newcastle the striker having had no idea he was for sale however his sustained success and prolific goal scoring quickly silenced his critics cole spent six years at old trafford winning five premier league titles and the treble in 1999 he scored 121 goals for the club cementing his status as the joint fourth highest goalscorer in premier league history inter to arsenal 7 5m under ars ne wenger bergkamp is credited with redefining premier league forwards his unique style was rooted in the dutch total football philosophy which gave him an understanding of positioning and movement bergkamp was not a traditional striker he was a deep lying forward who derived more pleasure from assisting goals than scoring them this role combined with his textbook technique made him the hub of arsenal creativity for a decade alongside thierry henry and he was instrumental in two doubles and the invincibles season leeds to manchester united 29 1m in 2002 ferdinand broke the british transfer record for the second time after leeds reluctantly sold the defender to their manchester rivals at a time when defenders were valued for their ruggedness ferdinand s transfer redefined the position he

blockbuster transfer but the argentinian lasted only two seasons before being sold for about half his record breaking fee his talent was staunchly defended by ferguson who called the press fucking

to adapt the team to him ver n struggled to cope with the premier league later admitting to labouring with consistency and durability real madrid to manchester city 32 5m chelsea became victims of the transfer hijack after robinho s move to manchester city the deal was so last minute that at his introductory press conference he mistakenly announced on the last day chelsea made a great proposal and i accepted before a reporter s correction while robinho was meant to be a status symbol for city s new owners a sign they could now compete with the biggest clubs his on field performances never lived up to the billing he was inconsistent in his first season and his tenure effectively ended in his second after he left a training camp without informing the manager mark hughes liverpool to chelsea 50m torres s transfer to chelsea marked the beginning of a dramatic decline for a goal scoring juggernaut at anfield a persistent knee injury from which he rushed back to be fit for the 2010 world cup resulted in a significant loss of pace that torres never recovered despite his overall struggles he did provide one moment of crucial brilliance the vintage goal at the camp nou that cemented chelsea

mar a failed to find a consistent role or rhythm ultimately sealing his unhappy exit juventus to manchester united 89m pogba s return to manchester united for a then world record fee was the ultimate homecoming narrative the pogback that garnered immense buzz but his second spell at the club was a disappointment while he provided spectacular runs of form he failed to function as the galvanising

a t 12 23pm on wednesday as the rightwing influencer and provocateur charlie kirk was addressing a large crowd at utah valley university a single shot rang out he was struck fatally by a bullet in the neck sending thousands of screaming students scattering in all directions and propelling the country into a new and dangerous crisis exactly one minute later at 12 24pm about 450 miles to the east in colorado a 911 call came in to first responders in the mountain town of evergreen a 16 year old student had opened fire with a revolver on high school grounds critically injuring two fellow students before turning the handgun on himself the confluence of two bloody incidents just one minute apart the first taking the life of a key figure in donald trump s make america great again maga movement the second erupting in the same school district as the notorious 1999 columbine massacre underlined america s dirty little non secret the ubiquitous quotidian nature of its gun violence yesterday was a dark day in the united states the former republican political strategist and trump critic steve schmidt said on his podcast on thursday it was a day of mass violence of killing of gun violence in other words in america it was a day like any other day the sense of shock that has ricocheted across the us since the kirk shooting has been palpable cable news shows and social media feeds have been overflowing with intense browbeating and soul searching about the parlous and perilous state of the nation there have been umpteen calls to prayer plenty of partisan name calling and even dark warnings about a coming civil war what has been noticeable by its absence though is virtually any talk about the instrument that lies at the heart of america s copious ongoing blood letting the gun america is an insanely violent nation said hasan piker a progressive influencer who had been scheduled to debate with kirk at a university in new hampshire later this month on his twitch stream following the shooting piker lamented the lack of meaningful debate about reforming the country s globally lax gun laws a bulletproof vest would not have saved charlie kirk security did not save charlie kirk the only thing that could have potentially saved charlie kirk from getting shot in the neck was reasonable gun control adam winkler a law professor at ucla and author of a book on the second amendment right to bear arms gunfight told the guardian that americans had shown a stubborn resistance to gun safety reform through equally terrible shooting incidents in the past they include horrors such as the killing of 20 elementary school children in newtown connecticut in 2012 and the mass murder of 60 people five years later at a music festival in las vegas people s positions on the second amendment and gun policy have really hardened in recent years winkler said it seems like americans are impervious to shooting based reforms we re just not seeing this i don t think this week s tragedies are likely to shift the substance of the debate or the current stalemate on guns kirk had been discussing gun violence at the moment that he was shot sitting on a sparkling cloudless day in the shade of a tent bearing the logo of his american comeback tour the turning point usa leader was sparring by microphone with students over how many mass shooters in the past decade had been transgender too many he said in fact trans people have carried out a tiny fraction of mass shootings the fact checking group politifact found kirk s own views on guns in america were reflective of the prevailing attitude across the maga universe which is fiercely protective of the second amendment despite the evident side effects of such devotion kirk being kirk his willingness to confront his detractors face to face was summed up in his slogan prove me wrong he articulated his passion for gun rights in brutally frank terms in a speech in salt lake city two years ago that has been widely resurfaced on social media in the wake of his death kirk argued that the benefits of having guns in many american hands outweighed the costs gun deaths were inevitable in such a heavily armed society he admitted but the prevalence of firearms allowed citizens to defend yourself against a tyrannical government i think it s worth it he said i think it s worth it to have a cost of unfortunately some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other god given rights that is a prudent deal it s rational kirk went on to repeat the mantra that the pro gun national rifle association nra touted in the wake of the newtown tragedy the solution to gun violence is more guns if our money and our sporting events and our airplanes have armed guards why don t our children such a hardline pro gun posture has been echoed by trump in the wake of the 2017 las vegas massacre in the early stages of his first term in the white house trump backed raising the age of gun possession to 21 and even lent his name to comprehensive background checks which have long been a central demand of gun control advocates it is not clear what made him change his mind was it pressure from the nra or from his own supporters but he quickly and quietly backed off the idea the only change in gun policy in the second trump administration has been in the direction of loosening regulations his recent mega finance bill removed taxes from short barrelled rifles and shotguns and he has instructed his attorney general pam bondi to aggressively roll back measures to reduce gun violence introduced by his predecessor joe biden in the immediate aftermath of the kirk assassination trump has signaled that he will be guided not by a desire to get to the root of the problem but by a desire for vengeance he has blamed the shooting on the radical left disregarding recent atrocities against democrats including the june shooting of democratic minnesota lawmakers in which one was killed in a statement from the oval office trump has insinuated that he intends to crack down on leftist civil society organisations there has so far been no talk of similarly cracking down on guns there s just no way that trump is going to support gun reform winkler said meanwhile one of the bedrock causes of america s unique struggle with gun violence goes untouched an analysis by the trace a news outlet reporting on the issue estimates that there are almost 400m guns in circulation in the us that s more than the number of people living in the country more than four in 10 americans live in households with a gun according to the pew research center though there is a partisan political divide in ownership with 45 of republicans owning a gun that still leaves one in five democrats also holding deadly weapons as the number of guns has risen so too have gun deaths almost 47 000 people died by the gun in the us in 2023 the latest year for which the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has produced official figures that s the third highest year on record after a pandemic induced spike in the previous two years the argument frequently proffered by second amendment lobbyists that this is just the way it is can easily be squelched by comparison with other rich countries a 2016 cdc study cited by pew put the us gun death rate at 10 6 per 100 000 people more than five times the rate in canada 2 1 per 100 000 and almost 20 times that of spain 0 6 such alarming statistics are set against a powerful subculture in which the gun manufacturing industry and pro gun groups and magazines actively promote the allure of the sniper best civilian sniper rifles was the headline from gunmag warehouse the online site outdoor life ran a feature on 16 of the best sniper rifles defining the weapon broadly as the one that is most capable of fulfilling the mission that whoever is carrying it is tasked with the author emphasised the huge variety of environments in which the sniper rifle has to operate including crowded cities first on the list was the ai axsr which was praised for its toughness innovation and accuracy the weapon trades to civilians for 11 000 on online firearms sites the gun that delivered the single shot that ended kirk s life has been described by us investigators as a mauser high powered bolt action rifle though it was not a purpose built sniper rifle it was precise enough to allow the killer to strike from a rooftop about 160 metres away from his target josh sugarmann executive of the violence policy center which has tracked the proliferation of the sniper subculture sees its growth as part of the increasing militarization of the gun industry and its civilian offerings no one notices or seems to care that there is an industry actively designing and building the weapons that enable shooters to more effectively commit assassinations and mass shootings he said the gun industry is designing building and promoting rifles that are effective at much longer range with the goal of one shot one kill
though the suspect in the killing of conservative activist charlie kirk was revealed by authorities on friday questions surrounding his identity and motivations have exacerbated intense us political debates in the aftermath of the shooting authorities revealed kirk s suspected killer to be tyler robinson a 22 year old man who grew up in washington utah along the state s south western border in absence of a clear motive for the slaying reports have tried to piece together information about robinson and his background he is a third year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at dixie technical college in the state both of his parents are registered republicans though his personal political beliefs remain unclear now deleted pictures on social media show robinson and his family posing with guns in an interview with the wall street journal published on saturday utah s governor spencer cox said it s very clear to us and to investigators that this was a person who was deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology cox cited the findings of the ongoing investigation into robinson and his possible motive but did not provide any further details about how officials arrived at that conclusion the fbi declined to comment about reporting on saturday including by conservative media outlets fox news and the new york post citing law enforcement sources that robinson lived with a partner who was trans a member of a community against whom kirk rallied and was cooperating with investigators meanwhile citing a half dozen of its own sources familiar with the case the left leaning axios said authorities were investigating whether robinson believed kirk s views on gender identity were hateful to people like robinson s transgender roommate regardless cox s remarks were published a day after he delivered a speech following robinson s arrest in which he had a candid moment about robinson s identity as a utahn bad stuff happens and for 33 hours i was praying that if this had to happen here it wouldn t be one of us cox said that somebody drove from another state somebody came from another country sadly that prayer was not answered the way i hoped for he went on to explain that it would have been easier on us if the suspect weren t from the community just because i thought it would make it easier on us to say hey we don t do that here indeed utah is a special place we lead the nation in charitable giving we lead the nation in service every year cox said tears welling in his eyes but it did happen here and it was one of us after robinson s identity was revealed some conservatives have softened their attacks against kirk s alleged murderer as an individual but continue to leverage anger toward liberals as a group republican congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina tweeted on wednesday that it s time to bring back the death penalty following kirk s murder on friday mace said that kirk would want us to pray for such an evil and lost individual like tyler robinson to find jesus christ we will try to do the same she wrote she later doubled down on the death penalty saying some crimes are so evil the only just punishment is the death penalty but referring to the way the suspect s father reportedly had a role in turning him over to authorities she also said we are sending prayers and our high regards to tyler robinson s father for doing the right thing cox s speech has largely been praised as highlighting unity during a divisive moment providing a stark contrast to donald trump who considered kirk a close ally the president on friday

emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion the radicals on the right are radical because they don t want to see crime trump said the radicals on the left are the problem and they are vicious and horrible and politically savvy they want men in women s sports they want transgender people they want open borders the worst thing that happened to this country conservatives had latched onto reports that have since been retracted that the casings for bullets found with the gun that police suspect was used to kill kirk were engraved with markings indicating trans ideology to the surprise of literally no one megyn kelly said on her show earlier in the aftermath of kirk s killing there s one particular group that s been running around killing americans in the name of ideology and it s transgender activists or individuals or those who proclaim that they are once robinson s identity was revealed kelly speculated that robinson must have been radicalized after going to college this kid got radicalized and obviously had a psychotic break i am disturbed to see that he appears to have come from a loving intact family kelly said if you look at the family social media profile it looks like a happy family it looks like a loving mom and a loving dad he had two younger brothers there s lots of family photos of them going on vacations and family dinners kelly noted that while authorities will be seeking the death penalty it is ultimately a mental health issue that underpins the radicalization of young people who go to college meanwhile white nationalist nick fuentes sought to shut down speculation that robinson may have been a groyper a nickname for a follower of fuentes after reports on the engravings on the bullets of the alleged killer s gun led to theorizing on his ideology groypers had long criticized kirk and trolled speakers at his events because the former perceived the latter to be too politically moderate while fuentes claimed in a social media post that he and his followers were currently being framed for the murder of charlie kirk he also said in a streaming video i pray to god there is no further violence to all of my followers if you take up arms i disavow you fuentes said i disown you in the strongest possible terms

allies including the uk france canada australia and belgium rubio before his departure on sunday told reporters obviously we re not happy about it the president was not happy about it now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next he stressed the incident was not going to change the nature of our relationship with the israelis the netanyahu government is seeking to play down any rift with the trump administration over the doha strike while remaining defiant over the attack we have a very close dialogue with the administration we re coordinated with them and relatively speaking the american reaction was reasonable the israeli ambassador to the un danny danon said on israeli army radio at the un security council they expressed reservations but the reservations were minor we took into account that this would have a price the qataris are trying to ride on this from their perspective they are leveraging this incident from our perspective we delivered the clear message that we

the war the talk of a ceasefire still out of reach after months of failed negotiations came as israel has been intensifying its campaign in the gaza strip in recent days it has ramped up efforts to seize control of gaza city the territory s largest urban area telling residents to evacuate and blowing up numerous high rise buildings it said were being used by hamas while thousands of people have evacuated the city according to the israeli military and hamas many more remain gaza s civil defence agency said 32 people were killed by israeli fire on saturday netanyahu and his government have defied international criticism throughout the nearly two year war but it continued to mount this week on friday the un general assembly voted to back a revival of the two state solution in open defiance of israeli opposition israeli allies britain and france alongside several other western countries are preparing to recognise palestinian statehood at a un gathering this month out of exasperation at israel s conduct of the gaza war and in the occupied west bank london and paris joined by berlin also called for an immediate halt to israel s offensive in gaza city nevertheless israel retains the backing of its most powerful ally and biggest arms supplier the us before rubio s visit the state department spokesperson tommy pigott said the us s top diplomat would show our commitment to fight anti israel actions including unilateral recognition of a palestinian state that rewards hamas terrorism he will also emphasise our shared goals ensuring hamas never rules over gaza again and bringing all the hostages home in israel opponents of the netanyahu government have sought to put pressure on ministers to end the war in return for the release of israeli hostages held in gaza on saturday the hostages and missing families forum the main campaign group accused the israeli prime minister of being the one obstacle to freeing the hostages and accused him of repeatedly sabotaging ceasefire efforts of the 251 people taken hostage by hamas militants in october 2023 47 remain in gaza including 25 whom the israeli military says are dead the war was sparked by hamas s october 2023 attack on israel which resulted in the deaths of 1 219 people mostly civilians according to an agence france presse tally of official figures israel s retaliatory campaign in gaza has killed at least 64 803 people also mostly civilians according to figures from gaza s hamas run health ministry which the un considers reliable with agence france presse and reuters
early on 18 march 1976 francisco ten rio cerqueira j nior a brazilian pianist who had played alongside some of latin america s greatest musicians disappeared from the streets of buenos aires for nearly 50 years his fate has remained a mystery sparking desperate searches raising suspicions of government complicity and inspiring international documentaries now the mystery has been solved with forensic scientists formally identifying ten rio j nior s body and confirming he was a victim of argentina s bloody dictatorship he left his hotel in the centre of the city and the earth ate him said carlos maco somigliana of the argentinian forensic anthropology team eaaf nothing more was ever known until now ten rio j nior known to most as tenorinho was regarded as one of the leading figures of the bossa nova movement brazil s celebrated fusion of samba and jazz one critic praised him as a pianist with hands of gold and an enormous future on 17 march 1976 during a south american tour he performed alongside the brazilian legends vin cius de moraes and toquinho at the gran rex in buenos aires around three o clock the following morning the 34 year old left his downtown hotel in search of cigarettes and aspirin and was never seen again in the days that followed his fellow musicians searched frantically combing through the hospitals and morgues moraes the lyricist of the girl from ipanema filed a habeas corpus writ and appealed directly to the brazilian ambassador by then tenorinho a husband and father of four was already dead he had been seized by the argentinian military and executed his body dumped in wasteland 30km away his killing came less than a week before a military coup d tat which plunged the country into a dark chapter of fear torture and forced disappearances over seven years tens of thousands of political opponents student activists journalists intellectuals and countless bystanders would be abducted held in clandestine detention centres tortured and killed some were thrown alive from planes others disposed of in mass graves human rights groups estimate that as many as 30 000 people were disappeared decades after tenorinho s disappearance at the 2014 national truth commission his widow carmen magalh es ten rio cerqueira demanded answers for what happened to her husband where is tenorinho she pressed ten rio was a person who never had any involvement with politics he was a person who lived for music and what happened to him is really something that is absurd she said toquinho channeled his pain into a song called lembran as or memories ten rio went out alone into the night he disappeared no one could explain over the years various witnesses came forward a man working at a newsstand near the hotel said he saw tenorinho taken away in a green ford falcon the infamous car of choice used by argentina s death squads official confirmation of what happened would finally come thanks primarily to an argentinian forensic team which to this day excavates and identifies those disappeared by the military regime the group was originally set up by the texas forensic anthropologist dr clyde snow renowned for identifying the skeleton of the nazi doctor josef mengele after argentina s return to democracy they made an unusual team at first unable to find willing colleagues with many argentinians still fearful of a return to the dictatorship snow had instead recruited a collection of anthropology students none of us were jumping with joy to do this because if we started to work on this and a new military coup occurred we would end up on the list of people who could disappear said mercedes mimi doretti one of the founders last year but at the same time we couldn t say no decades on the group continues to search for the victims of the dictatorship scouring archives interviewing witnesses corroborating timelines and conducting digs at suspected mass graves today technological advances also have made it possible to conduct mass fingerprint comparisons the technique that ultimately led to tenorinho s discovery more than 1 500 bodies have been recovered and more than 840 people identified at the same time that the state had been torturing killing and throwing people from planes they kept their bureaucratic ways of working recording deaths taking fingerprints of the corpses said somigliana who has worked with the eaaf since 1986 in many cases the state tried to avoid this by burning the bodies cutting hands off but in others they left a chain of documents while the team had been seeking tenorinho s fingerprints for some years his case gained momentum in 2024 when the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity found an old file containing the details of a murder victim who had appeared in a small unoccupied piece of land in the tigre district on 20 march 1976 the death certificate said man with many gunshots around 30 years old with a beard said somigliana we compared the fingerprints with all of those people kidnapped in argentina and there was no match why because he was not from argentina then we asked for the fingerprints from brazil and when they came we were able to confirm that this body was him tenorinho s unnamed body was buried at the benav dez municipal cemetery on 22 march 1976 but later excavated and put into a common grave at present there are no plans to begin exhumations of the common grave while the identification does not in itself prove the military killed tenorinho the manner of his murder and the way his body was discarded mirror the fate of countless others disappeared by the military his remains were discovered in the same area where other victims of clandestine detention centres had been dumped cases later proven to be linked directly to the regime he was also shot more than once the typical way the military killed victims while the typical registration of the death taking the fingerprints and photos of the body was conducted his identification was not completed a further hallmark of state crimes the eaaf said they had no reason to doubt tenorinho was a victim of state terrorism in the days before the military coup tenorinho who was born in laranjeiras in rio de janeiro was one of 11 brazilians kidnapped in argentina during the dictatorship he had no political affiliations and it has long been surmised that he was picked up for how he looked he wore glasses and had a long beard features which the dictatorship associated with leftists he left behind his wife carmen who was also eight months pregnant at the time of his disappearance and four other children his parents who for years sought answers to their son s whereabouts died around the 10th anniversary of his murder his surviving family was informed of the identification this week tenorinho s identification comes against an emerging climate of denialism in argentina in late 2023 argentina elected javier milei as its president a hard right leader who has been accused by rights organisations of attempting to rewrite the history of the dictatorship s crimes he has previously declared there were no 30 000 people disappeared and calling into question the extent of the military s crimes his party has also begun dismantling the human rights secretariat downgrading the body and recently laying off hundreds of workers last year six lawmakers from milei s la libertad avanza party visited a jail to meet prisoners convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the 1976 1983 dictatorship including alfredo astiz the so called angel of death the politicians later claimed they were reviewing the living conditions of the detainees the office of the prosecutor for crimes against humanity nonetheless is continuing its dictatorship era work and is currently reviewing cases involving the discovery of unidentified corpses in public streets in the province of buenos aires between 1975 and 1983 we have already identified approximately 600 files 475 of which are under analysis said mar a ngeles ramos one of the country s lead federal prosecutors of dictatorship era crimes the eaaf which operates as a non profit is also committed to continuing its work the team as become world renowned finding and identifying remains all over the world including genocide victims in darfur and the bodies of the chilean president salvador allende and guerrilla icon che guevara
the un secretary general has condemned the reported killing of at least 40 people during an attack by armed gangs in a fishing village north of haiti s capital media in haiti widely reported that the attack took place on thursday night in labodrie it is another sign of escalating gang violence that has spread outside the capital the secretary general is alarmed by the levels of violence rocking haiti and urges the haitian authorities to ensure that perpetrators of these and all other human rights abuses and violations are brought to justice the un said in a statement a spokesperson for the national police declined to comment on the alleged killings haitian media reported that gangs set labodrie on fire after the killing of a gang leader who goes by the name vladimir he was a member of a gang alliance known as viv ansanm that the us declared a terrorist organisation in may the us state department said the viv ansanm alliance was among the primary causes of instability and violence in haiti its members have taken control of large swaths of the capital port au prince and spread to surrounding areas
a third of uk employers are using bossware technology to track workers activity with the most common methods including monitoring emails and web browsing private companies are most likely to deploy in work surveillance and one in seven employers are recording or reviewing screen activity according to a uk wide survey that estimates the extent of office snooping the findings shared with the guardian by the chartered management institute cmi are based on responses from hundreds of uk managers and suggest there has been a recent growth in computerised work surveillance in 2023 less than a fifth of people thought they were being monitored by an employer the information commissioner s office ico found the finding that about a third of managers report their organisations are monitoring workers online activities on employer owned devices is probably an underestimate as roughly the same proportion said they don t know what tracking their organisations do many monitoring systems are aimed at preventing insider threats and safeguarding sensitive information as well as detecting productivity dips but the trend appears to be causing unease a large minority of managers are opposed to the practice saying it undermines trust with staff and invades their personal privacy the cmi found one manager at an insurance company which is developing ai systems to monitor staff screen activity to track performance said it was unsettling do they not trust their employees to do their jobs and are they looking to replace them with ai they said one provider of employee monitoring offers to report on workers idle time employee productivity tracking and use of unapproved ai or social media as well as real time insights into employee behaviour including screenshots screen recordings keystrokes and app usage in response to the findings the ico said bosses must make their employees aware of the nature extent and reasons for monitoring and said excessive monitoring can undermine people s privacy especially if they are working from home it warned it will take action if necessary last year the ico stopped the outsourcing company serco from using facial recognition technology and fingerprint scanning to monitor the attendance of staff at a chain of leisure centres monitoring often amounts to checks that inappropriate content is not being accessed the cmi said but it warned there s a longer term impact if you are feeling this is big brother like and you are being watched if it is being used it is incredibly important employers are open otherwise that s going to cause significant problems in terms of data privacy and protection said petra wilton cmi director of policy and external affairs other recent examples of surveillance technology at work include plans by hsbc to install a large numbers of security cameras 1 754 by one estimate and biometric readers which use handprints as one way to access areas in its new london headquarters sign up to business today get set for the working day we ll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion the accountancy firm pwc recently introduced a traffic light system using data from pass swipes and wifi connections to check staff are meeting a mandate to attend the office at least three days a week a spokesperson for pwc said this was accepted by the vast majority of our people a former senior worker at a public transport authority who asked not to be named called the monitoring they faced including of their online diary intrusive and downright harassment it started with surveillance and it ended with me leaving because i was so infuriated they said one in six managers also told the cmi researchers they would consider looking for a new job if their organisation started monitoring employees online activities on work devices among managers who knew their organisations carried out surveillance 35 were monitoring emails overall tracking log in and log off times and system access were the most popular form of surveillance the study found that 53 of managers supported monitoring of employees online activities on employer owned devices but 42 opposed it mostly because it undermines trust but also because they believe it does not improve performance and can be misused or lead to unfair judgments or disciplinary actions
if he wins his fall election zohran mamdani would order new york s police department to arrest benjamin netanyahu in the event that the israeli prime minister ever traveled there the city s leading mayoral candidate said in a recent interview mamdani the democratic nominee in the 4 november election alleged to the new york times on thursday that netanyahu was a war criminal who was committing genocide with israel s military campaign in gaza according to a report published by the outlet on friday he said he would honor an international criminal court icc arrest warrant issued in november 2024 for netanyahu s arrest over alleged gaza war crimes by having the israeli leader taken into custody at the airport if he ever steps foot in new york and mamdani is the mayor this is something that i intend to fulfill mamdani remarked reiterating a pledge he had made earlier in the mayoral race as the times put it it is my desire to ensure that this be a city that stands up for international law in new york the city s police commissioner serves at the pleasure of its mayor but the times report cited legal experts who judged that having netanyahu arrested would be a practical impossibility for mamdani and could bring him into direct conflict with the federal government the us does not recognize the icc s authority and is not a party to the body whose headquarters are at the hague in the netherlands in february donald trump ordered economic sanctions against the icc with the president maintaining that the court lacked jurisdiction over the us or israel netanyahu for his part said in july at a meeting alongside trump that he was not concerned about mamdani s wishes to have him arrested he suggested he would travel with trump and then we ll see if he was arrested as the times noted trump at the time added that mamdani better behave otherwise he s going to have big problems the times alluded to polling which showed that new yorkers now generally express support for palestinians over israel in the latter s war with hamas nonetheless the outlet said it anticipated mamdani s comments would provoke strong reactions in the city which is the world s second largest home to jews behind only the israeli capital tel aviv a poll released on wednesday showed mamdani a democratic socialist state assemblyman led former new york governor andrew cuomo by a dominant 15 percentage points with less than two months to go in the race to take charge of one of the world s most prominent cities cuomo is running as an independent after losing june s democratic primary to mamdani behind both mamdani and cuomo in the survey from emerson college polling pix11 and the hill were republican nominee curtis sliwa and incumbent mayor eric adams who is also running as an independent recent reports say advisers to trump a republican and new york native have sought to set up a two candidate race between mamdani and cuomo possibly by arranging potential presidential administration roles for adams and sliwa a times siena university poll estimated mamdani s lead over cuomo would shrink to four percentage points if adams and sliwa dropped out of the mayoral contest adams and sliwa though have both said they do not intend to abandon the race
fierce clashes broke out in pakistan near the border with afghanistan when pakistani security forces raided two hideouts of the pakistani taliban killing 12 soldiers and 35 militants the military said on saturday twenty two militants were killed in the first raid in bajaur a district in north western khyber pakhtunkhwa province thirteen more were killed in a separate operation in south waziristan district the incidents underline the struggles pakistan faces as it tries to contain the resurgence of militant groups the country has faced a rise in attacks in recent years most claimed by the pakistani taliban also known as tehrik e taliban pakistan or ttp the ttp calls itself the world s biggest jihadist front and has committed a number of high profile attacks including the attempted murder of the peace activist malala yousafzai the murder of pakistan s former prime minister benazir bhutto and the attempted bombing of times square in new york the taliban s takeover of afghanistan in 2021 emboldened the ttp and gave militants a haven over the border from where they can conduct operations against pakistan this has led to a deterioration of ties between pakistan and afghanistan the pakistani military urged the taliban government in kabul to to uphold its responsibilities and deny use of its soil for terrorist activities against pakistan the military described the dead militants as khawarij a term referring to a radical sect that emerged during the early years of islam which the government uses for the ttp it alleged the militants were backed by india though provided no evidence pakistan has long accused india of supporting the ttp and separatists in balochistan which new delhi denies there was no immediate comment from the taliban in kabul or from new delhi saturday s attack was one of the deadliest in months in khyber pakhtunkhwa province where the ttp once controlled areas of territory last month the pakistani military launched a targeted operation against militants in bajaur a former stronghold which displaced tens of thousands of people
doctors and medical staff at the largest big hospital still functioning in gaza say they will be overwhelmed by a wave of new wounded and sick patients if hundreds of thousands of palestinians flee the north of the devastated territory in the face of an intensifying israeli offensive dr mohammed saqr director of nursing at the nasser medical complex near khan younis in the south of gaza said there were not enough staff to cope with even existing demand and that supplies of medicine and fuel were running low we have been working for more than 23 months in an emergency situation so we are all exhausted saqr said in a voice note sent from the complex on friday some of us are still in israeli jails and others were killed inside the hospital and outside and others had to leave the gaza strip to escape death so our numbers are not like before the war there appears little chance of any new ceasefire after israel s strike on qatar last week the attack targeted the leadership of hamas who were meeting in the gulf state to consider new terms for a deal set out by donald trump health authorities in gaza announced last week they would not evacuate gaza city s two main operational hospitals al shifa and al ahli and that doctors would not leave patients unattended the un s world health organization pledged its workers would remain in gaza city despite calls from israel s military for the estimated 1 million people living and sheltering there to evacuate before a new offensive but doctors at al ahli which has been under evacuation orders for weeks described a situation beyond any human mind can imagine or can conceive and said they might be forced to comply with the israeli evacuation orders you see towers 20 storeys high collapse in less than two seconds when hit by an israeli airstrike you see thousands of families running for their lives in the streets with their kids you see the kids being slaughtered you see limbs being mutilated said dr khamis elessi a consultant pain specialist at the hospital there are now three times more patients than beds at al ahli which has received as many as 400 cases on some days in the past month the facility has only three icu beds and many casualties with serious injuries including broken limbs have been sent home to wait for surgery i hope i hope we will survive said khamis at al shifa hospital once the biggest health facility in gaza city but now barely functioning doctors also said they would stay i will go to the south with my family and make sure they are safe and then i will return to gaza to continue working at al shifa hospital god willing said one medics at nasser described a daily routine of dealing with death and severe injuries inflicted by bomb blasts and bullets we are dealing with a lot of blast injuries shrapnel and bullet wounds if this was in the us it would be a huge mass casualty incident every day for me it is absolutely overwhelming but i m told these are good days compared with last month said dr tipu khan from ventura california who arrived at the hospital 10 days ago as a volunteer with medglobal many casualties are young men and children often teenagers injured close to aid distribution hubs that are run by the us and israel backed gaza humanitarian foundation and protected by israeli troops khan said every morning like clockwork we get seven eight 10 young adolescent males with blast or gunshot wounds some come in with a retained bullet in the brain or chest these are devastating injuries and three or four are either actively dying or not saveable khan said the israeli military has denied firing deliberately on civilians seeking aid from the ghf sites and says it takes all feasible precautions to prevent civilian casualties in gaza khan said that some basic supplies were running short at nasser such as equipment for blood pressure readings and anaesthetics the hospital where an israeli strike killed 20 people including journalists and health workers last month is turning off electricity on certain days in some departments and corridors to conserve limited stocks of fuel for generators officials there said saqr said he feared the sprawling facility which provides more than half the total hospital beds in gaza might be forced to shut down if the israeli military operations expand further evacuating nasser complex means that thousands of patients will inevitably die because there are no other places to go other hospital and fields clinics in the south of gaza are not equipped to deal with 1 000 admitted cases if we are ordered to evacuate a lot of patients would inevitably die he said tedros adhanom ghebreyesus director general of the world health organization said last week that what israel has designated as a humanitarian zone in the south of the gaza strip has neither the size nor scale of services to support those already there let alone new arrivals israeli officials claims that they are working to increase health service provision in the south of gaza have been met with scepticism by experts and aid workers the war started after a hamas attack on israel in october 2023 that killed 1 200 people mostly civilians and led to 250 being abducted fifty hostages remain in gaza the israeli offensive that followed has killed more than 64 000 mostly civilians and injured more than 160 000 khan said he had seen the devastation in haiti after the earthquake there in 2010 but that gaza was different haiti was a natural disaster but the hardest thing here is that it is 100 preventable he said
military history is littered with the corpses of apex predators the gatling gun the battleship the tank all once possessed unassailable power then were undermined in some cases wiped out by the march of new technology speed and stealth and firepower the head of the australian submarine agency jonathan mead told the guardian two years ago of australia s forthcoming fleet of nuclear submarines the apex predator of the oceans but for how much longer in the first quarter of the 21st century nuclear submarines have proven a formidable force essentially undetectable deadly attack weapons some also carry a vital second strike deterrent effect any attack on a country armed with nuclear powered submarines is made with the knowledge that retaliation is certain from a warship hidden beneath the waves but a drumbeat of declarations much of it speculative but most of it from china the very nation the aukus pact was established to counter report rapid developments in submarine detection technologies vast networks of acutely sensitive sonar arrays quantum sensing improved satellite tracking able to spot tiny perturbations in the ocean s surface technologies that detect minute disturbances in the earth s magnetic field real time ai processing of vast reams of data could emerging technologies render the last opaque place on earth the oceans transparent it may not be so binary the oceans may become in parts less impenetrable key contested sea lanes and littoral areas may be intensely surveilled while remote deep trenches remain arcane forecasting a future conflict is fraught but the consequences for australia having dedicated an extraordinary 368bn towards its aukus nuclear submarine fleet are immense will the apex predator of today become the prey of tomorrow one brutal assessment put it in stark terms australia s fleet of nuclear powered submarines may end up being billion dollar coffins pillar one of the australia uk us aukus agreement involves australia being given the technology to command its own fleet of conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines there are two stages first australia will buy between three and five virginia class nuclear powered submarines from the us the first of these in 2032 but before any boat can be sold to australia the us commander in chief the president of the day must certify that the us relinquishing a submarine will not diminish its navy s undersea capability the us submarine fleet now has only three quarters of the submarines it needs 49 boats of a force level goal of 66 and there are significant concerns the us cannot build enough submarines for its own needs let alone any for australia second by the late 2030s according to the optimal pathway outlined in australia s submarine industry strategy the uk will launch the first specifically designed and built aukus submarine for britain s royal navy the first australian built aukus submarine for the royal australian navy will be in the water in the early 2040s australia will build up to eight aukus boats with the final vessels launched in the 2060s each of australia s nuclear submarines is forecast to have a working life of about three decades australia will be responsible for securing and storing the nuclear waste from its submarines including high level nuclear waste and spent fuel a weapons proliferation risk for thousands of years aukus is forecast to cost australia up to a 368bn to the mid 2050s there is an arms race under way underwater dedicated to perfecting the technologies that can find submarines and finding new ways to keep them hidden vast resources are being poured into improving detection technologies and developing new ones drones sonobuoys satellites magnetometers quantum sensors all seek to shrink the spaces where submarines can hide everything is being monitored the tiniest disturbance in waves across vast stretches of ocean fractionally altered sea temperatures faint magnetic disturbances bioluminescent trails each could give a tiny clue to a submarine s path combined they could reveal precisely where it is allied to the extraordinary data processing power of artificial intelligence these present a formidable threat to submarines invisibility ai programs are able to cut through the noise of masses of information spotting unseen patterns or finding connections between disparate pieces of data imperceptible to a human analyst much of the technological advancement is being driven by china submarines made of metal cause tiny distortions in the earth s magnetic field as they move through the water changes increasingly detectable to sophisticated magnetometers sign up au breaking news email last year a research team from shanghai jiao tong university reported the development of a new seabed sensor able to detect the faint electromagnetic waves generated by a rotating submarine propeller from nearly 20km away about 10 times the previous detection range and in a peer reviewed study published in december researchers in xi an claimed to have developed an airborne magnetometer that can track the persistent trace of a submarine s magnetic wake quantum sensors which can detect infinitesimally small perturbations in the environment at an atomic level promise even greater sensitivity and accuracy in april scientists from the china aerospace science and technology corporation said they had developed a drone mounted quantum sensor system that could track submarines with pinpoint accuracy they claim the coherent population trapping atomic magnetometer is as sensitive as the mad xr system used by nato countries but far cheaper and so able to be deployed at a massive scale these are the technologies that are known about but as dr anne marie grisogono of flinders university points out if an adversary had a technology to accurately detect submarines would it tell anyone the arms race is of course accelerating on both sides designers are working on counter detection measures to make submarines ever more covert anechoic tiles to defeat or confuse sonar cooling systems to weaken detection by thermal imaging or infrared detection by satellites degaussing submarines to reduce magnetic signatures and using pump jet propulsors to produce less wake grisogono was a co author of the 2020 report transparent oceans which argued that by the 2050s as new australian aukus boats continued to be sent to sea nuclear submarines will be able to be detected in the world s oceans because of the evolution of science and technology she told guardian australia this year the likelihood that the oceans will become transparent at some time is basically 100 it s just in what time frame and they could become transparent much sooner we ve seen tremendous advances in artificial intelligence an accelerant for all of these detection technologies that we are seeing developed grisogono argued that it may not be one technology that renders submarines detectable she can envisage a future of underwater meshes of networked sensors using different technologies all of which are expendable and none of which is critical to the network functioning it s an adaptive mesh of cheap components and importantly it s a distributed system so you can t really take it out she said you can lose quite a lot of them and still have a functioning network and it s cheap if your defensive system is really cheap and can take out really expensive assets from your opponent the advantage is now to the defence not to the attack grisogono said australia should use the opportunity before too much is committed to aukus to re evaluate its capacity not to fight a war in 20 years but in 30 40 or 50 we should be asking bigger questions about our defence posture she said i think acquiring these nuclear powered submarines really only makes sense if you re wanting to contribute and join into much bigger conflicts in the region with the us perhaps when the decision was first taken the logic of aukus might be defensible in some way but does that still stand up now sign up to breaking news australia get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion on a rainswept dock in sydney this week the australian government announced it had committed 1 7bn towards buying dozens precisely how many is classified of ghost shark autonomous underwater vehicles essentially an uncrewed submarine powered by ai the ghost shark the government says will be able to conduct intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and strike at extremely long distances from the australian continent with each one about the size of a minibus they can be deployed from warships or launched off the coast the guardian asked the defence minister richard marles whether the investment was a hedge against a future where crewed submarines were detectable we are very confident about australia s future submarines being fundamentally critical to australia s military capability marles responded saying the ghost sharks would complement crewed nuclear submarines while there s a whole lot of advancements in technologies about detecting submarines there s also a lot of advancements in technologies around making submarines harder to detect and we are really confident about giving australia a highly capable long range submarine capability in the future standing alongside the minister australia s chief of navy v adm mark hammond said he believed crewed submarines would grow more stealthy as efforts to detect them strengthened i ve heard about transparent oceans since i qualified in submarines 31 years ago and nothing s really changed every advancement in detection capability is usually met by an advancement in encounter detection capability and increased stealth the land and the air were completely transparent hammond said and no one has stopped building ships and aircraft my personal belief is that the undersea battle space will continue to be increasingly congested increasingly contested but ultimately that is the most opaque environment on the planet and i believe that our allies and partners will continue to enjoy the capability advantage in that space any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic prof peter w singer a strategist at the new america thinktank cites arthur c clarke s famed third law he tells the guardian that the rapid pace of change across technological domains accelerated by developments in ai makes predicting future developments especially beyond the span of a human or technological generation increasingly fraught australia s first aukus submarines are scheduled to be in the water in the 2040s they will still be under construction into the 2060s twenty years is a very long time when it comes to technology what s a generation for undersea warfare is it every 30 years every 15 years every 10 years we re talking about a pretty substantial period of time singer says an accelerating trend is greater observation of the battlefield and the worry that once stealthy systems might be detectable if they re detectable they re destroyable he says military leaders around the world are wrestling with this whether they are in the adf nato the us navy marine corps there s a trend where essentially the apex predators are looking around and wondering if they are now the prey the marianas trench largely uncharted and reaching depths beyond human exploration might remain unknowable singer says but key sea lanes in the south china sea could be intensely surveilled he cites the cold war example of the giuk gap naval choke points in the north atlantic which was populated by a battery of hydrophones designed to detect the passage of soviet submarines singer predicts that undersea warfare of the future will not be a battle between crewed submarines but between hybrid fleets of new technologies including unmanned underwater vehicles potentially working in concert with crewed subs uuvs will be far cheaper and expendable in comparison with traditional submarines the terrestrial equivalent is ukraine s revolutionary use of cheap but lethal armed drones to counter russia s invasion expendable drones worth a few hundred dollars a unit are taking out tanks that cost tens of millions halting entire offensives the uncrewed systems are not all going to be like a pet on a leash they re going to be increasingly operating on their own singer says so you may have some physically large systems that need to go long distances and carry massive payloads but you may also have smaller systems maybe with less range but because they re smaller they re cheaper and you can essentially fill the battle space with them the upshot is a balancing act singer says accepting that decision makers have neither a perfect view of the future nor an unlimited budget i am not saying don t buy virginia class or don t buy aukus he says i think they do bring value the question is how much of a bet do you want to make
jeffrey epstein was a very wealthy man but exactly how wealthy and where that money came from remains shrouded in mystery newly unearthed emails last week shone light on epstein s role as freelance client development officer acting as a channel between political figures and business titans greasing up the former with lifestyles they could not afford and the latter with avenues of political influence exposure of that channel ended the career of peter mandelson the uk ambassador to the us provoking a crisis in britain s labour government after emails showed that lord mandelson had steered a 1bn banking deal epstein s way and expressed sympathy for epstein s 2008 conviction for child sexual procurement emails obtained by bloomberg and others went further showing that figures in epstein s network of billionaires politicians celebrities royalty and intellectuals were assembled into schemes of influence jeffrey was a starfucker an acquaintance told the guardian last week anyone he thought had influence he would try to add to his collection mandelson is slippery and impressed by money so jeffrey liked that the spheres of influence epstein created emails showed relied simultaneously on access and gifts bloomberg obtained a spreadsheet of expenses that in some cases appeared to sync with emails between epstein and his former girlfriend and accomplice ghislaine maxwell the financier s convicted sex trafficking co conspirator one expense dated 21 december 2005 showed a 35 000 watch for db the same day that maxwell and epstein discussed in emails giving bill clinton aide doug band an audemars piguet with the same value band has denied receiving any watch in all the emails include a spreadsheet itemizing nearly 2 000 gifts luxury items and payments totaling 1 8m but the questions about the source of epstein s wealth have never been fully resolved he was worth nearly 600m at his death thanks mostly to two wealthy billionaire clients victoria s secret founder les wexner and later apollo global management co founder leon black as well as johnson johnson heiress elizabeth libet johnson sister of former us ambassador to the uk woody johnson between his collection of lavish homes in new york palm beach and paris two private caribbean islands two jets and helicopter epstein held nearly 380m in cash and investments according to his estate that wealth arrived suddenly according to associates until the end of the 90s epstein was living in a two bedroom apartment on manhattan s upper east side close to the river it was only when maxwell arrived from london that his lifestyle was dramatically elevated epstein moved to a townhouse on 68th street and later to a 28 000 sq ft mansion on 71st street later transferred to him by wexner in 2011 steven hoffenberg a former business partner of epstein convicted of running a ponzi scheme claimed that maxwell s father disgraced press baron robert maxwell introduced his daughter to epstein in the late 1980s a 2022 miami herald expos showed complex maxwell family transactions passing through companies in jersey the british virgin islands and panama that it called a decades long modus operandi of financial deception in a 2013 corporate filing epstein described himself as an experienced and successful financier and businessman an entrepreneur who has built several highly profitable companies and one of the pioneers of derivative and option based investing of the more than 800m in revenue wexner and black brought in from 1999 to 2018 according to financial statements obtained by the new york times epstein who was neither a licensed tax attorney nor a certified public accountant collected at least 490m in fees according to forbes the two businessmen supplied close to 75 of epstein s fee income during that period court records from a 2022 case brought against one of epstein s banks jpmorgan chase show that epstein s us virgin islands based companies were his only revenue generating companies from 1999 to his death in 2019 under the territories economic development program epstein is estimated to have saved 300m in taxes between 1999 and 2018 a 2023 report by the then senate finance committee chair ron wyden found black paid epstein 170m for purported tax and estate planning advice black has not been accused of wrongdoing he said in a 2020 earnings call that he deeply regretted his association with epstein a report from global law firm dechert found no evidence that black was involved in any way with epstein s criminal activities wexner claimed after epstein s arrest in 2019 that epstein had misappropriated more than 46m of his personal fortune and said in a letter to l brand employees i know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced and i deeply regret having ever crossed his path but by 2006 with wexner s patronage at an end epstein s financial trust company which had generated 300m in fees generated less than 5m over five years his 2008 conviction dealt a further blow and he returned to new york to salvage his reputation and business the new york times reported last week that despite internal red flags about suspicious cash withdrawals and transfers jpmorgan chase continued to consider epstein a treasured customer with more than 200m in accounts perhaps more importantly he unofficially served as a client developer for the private wealth management division jpmorgan chase has described its ties to epstein as a mistake epstein introduced bank executives to some figures who would become clients including google co founder sergey brin and to global leaders such as israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu bill gates elon musk and emirati billionaire sultan ahmed bin sulayem epstein received a 15m fee for smoothing the sale of a 1 3bn stake in glenn dubin s 7bn highbridge capital management hedge fund to the bank epstein s connections were by then more valuable than his wealth epstein s main connection to the bank was jes staley later ceo of barclays who was found by uk regulators to have misled them about his ties to epstein conspiracy theories that epstein was blackmailing his wealthy connections snaring them in honeytraps that included models brought into the us including by jean luc brunel founder of mc2 model management who like epstein died in prison while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges have not come to fruition but wherever the epstein scandal goes next and whomever else it brings down epstein moves like a zombie through the upper echelons of wealth and politics he operated a circle with many points of entry says the acquaintance but now he s like a wrecking ball rolling across countries

for days before her last hospital visit mom s texts worried me she sent them from the one room mountain cabin she shared with my stepfather mark they pinged each day on my phone like tiny arrows two dozen or more with random all caps mom making mark red velvet cake we have the gang of coyotes eating and harassing down below on the flats going to rest and take it easy and go tomorrow for food and water again me make sure you re hydrated mom i will sweet angel my 77 year old mother wanted sympathy the kind mark believed was for the weak offers of a cup of a tea a hug long ago decades even she had learned not to seek it from him with him she was a trooper at 62 she had retired and followed him up to a high desert mountain 6 500ft 1 981 metres in north east california two and a half hours from the nearest town their 20 acres 8 hectares were nothing but dry rock bitterbrush and a lone juniper here and there raising a gnarled arm against the horizon for 15 years they lived with no power or plumbing in a 150 sq ft cabin they had bought off craigsist a shack really so small there was no room for a couch or dining table so they ate on the bed she bathed with a basin of warm vinegar water and chose each night whether to squat over a chamber pot or trudge up the hill to the outhouse she took pride in her resilience but her deeper comfort was this he would never leave her but life was getting harder she was five years older than mark and off grid living was taking more of a toll on her her joints ached in the icy mornings utis plagued her she was losing her teeth by the next week she wrote that she had fallen twice which persuaded mark they needed to go to the hospital in susanville a five hour round trip underneath my genuine concern was a deeper fear that this could be another one of her veiled cries for help she had had a mystery illness years before and i had a familiar feeling that there was nothing actually wrong not physically instead i suspected she had hit the wall again with their grueling life on the mountain to declare her existence untenable to her husband to me to anyone was not an option like a house of cards her entire persona as his ride or die partner would collapse worst of all he might tell her to leave that he would be better off alone that for my mother was unthinkable after hours of tests of blood draws a ct scan an eeg the doctors could not find anything wrong but she felt dizzy she insisted she showed them taking slow stumbling steps leaning on the nurse s arm like a tipsy dance partner maybe she d had a small stroke they couldn t rule it out tossing and turning until after midnight i finally got a text at 12 20am mom in ambulance to reno i read the text again feeling cold then flushed i pictured the ambulance reeling across the dark desert night then across the state line from california to nevada headed to reno headed for me the next morning after a stop at trader joe s for a smoothie and a bouquet of flowers i found mom in the neurology ward in a room bigger than their cabin beside her the attending nurse typed notes into the standing computer a giant rolling cart like a mini office on wheels oh you re here that s my daughter my mother said clasping her hands to her chest she looked shrunken but happy in the imposing hospital bed she yelped with joy at the flowers and smoothie i tried to be honest with the nurse they have no power no generator no water they haul it up in 200 gallon jugs the nurse raised her eyebrows and typed that in then she looked at me so for showering outside in the summer with a hanging solar powered bag i said and added not sure if it would help five gallons hmm and in the winter mom and i exchanged a glance sponge baths with vinegar the nurse typed silently as i noted mom s hands wondering if this nurse had seen how dirty they were how could she not later i would need two washcloths to clean the dug in dust and dirt under her wedding ring the skin was a darker brown that needed extra scrubbing the nurse then asked about the bathroom layout well actually there s an outhouse a frown appeared briefly how far outside about 75ft mom told her then described the narrow path up the slope i pulled out my laptop at this point brought in case there was downtime to work and clicked on a picture it looked like an upright coffin on the hill see i showed her another one of the inside mom craned to look too and i noticed how smudgy her glasses were i dug a lens wipe out of my purse and unwrapped it while the nurse peered at the genuine toilet seat on top of the wooden bench the coffee can full of lime to sprinkle into the hole a roll of toilet paper mark had made a small shelf that held reading material a us army survival guide tattered copies of better homes and gardens and pioneer magazine so there s no handrail her frown was permanent now mom piped up eager to shift the mood mark can make one he ll nail up a branch the nurse nodded as if that was a normal workaround i would feel the familiar weight of her and others judgment over the coming week during those hospital visits i remembered being fascinated about feigned illnesses during war time in the civil war since most soldiers had little medical knowledge they usually faked something familiar like rheumatism the war department caught on and ended that by year two other common pretended ailments were heart disease vision problems and hemorrhoids for fake paralysis doctors would attach electrodes to the legs and flip the switch or press tubes of radium to the skin until it burned i was impressed by the ingenuity of one soldier who stuffed the heart of a turkey in his rectum to resemble piles others swallowed tobacco causing nausea and vomiting or coated their tongues with soap or chalk to combat these ruses doctors would give them awful duties such as cleaning vomit and feces so they would think their lot would be better back with their regiment another tactic would be to make the treatment worse than the illness by for example applying fly blisters to the spine or dosing them with castor oil i had a hunch mom was doing the same all the previous week she had made her own symptoms by drinking just enough to keep herself alive and eating the barest portions that made her dizzy and caused her falls one afternoon after another hospital visit i tried to figure out why i had been so quiet when it came to mom and mark i could sense the nurses friends and family members wanting me to confront my mother i had heard comments like get power of attorney call the sheriff this is elder abuse by defending mom s choices i suppose i was defending myself too i understood why she and mark loved the wild the city jangled my nerves and i missed small time life from my youth so when she wanted to return to their cabin i understood like her i had sacrificed monetary success for my writing living a life with few if any luxuries but i could no longer ignore that there was a cost to the quiet sure enough the problem with mom turned out to be hyponatremia a sodium deficiency due to dehydration they recommended gatorade and eight glasses of water every day this felt more than anticlimactic and my mother looked chagrined then she announced she wanted to be discharged immediately and go to my house but because the nurses had reported some unsteadiness when they walked her around she needed to go to the rehab hospital for seven to 10 days what mom yelled she shifted on the bed and the alarm blasted then stopped damn it i don t need any more care i can fall anytime anywhere at my daughter s for starters but you re weaker now one of the nurses pointed out then to everyone s astonishment she got up and danced a jig the alarm shrieked again see she shouted i m just fine please sit down the nurse said arms out as the intercom chimed in like the voice of god with furious defeat in her eyes mom glared at everyone in turn then folded her arms across her chest she knew she had to play along but her patience was cracking like a thin sheet of ice below that layer was anger even rage that anger was directed at the staff at the rules and maybe somewhere deeper also at herself she had made a pact with the man she loved decades before one that had since hardened and encircled her when i got home i made an appointment for my mother with a psychologist who had helped me get through my divorce it was a long shot but i hoped when this crying wolf episode was over and mom was out of rehab i could convince her to go to my surprise mom agreed to see dianna the psychologist on her next visit with me in reno on the night before the appointment she took an hour long hot bath slipped into the fleece pyjamas i had laid out for her and snuggled under the red electric blanket as always what she wanted to do was join an alcoholics anonymous phone meeting she loved to spend an hour listening to other people and how they pushed through the challenges of their lives she put it on speaker so i could hear the shares from the kitchen and after a while i could figure out the topic forgiveness fear self pity when it was her turn i listened in the hallway and her tone was off forced as if trying to reassure everyone that she was ok up on the mountain very fine actually and it s such an adventure and yes of course sometimes she feels sorry for herself very sorry actually especially when her fingers are as cold as frozen carrot sticks so she can t even text her daughter and yes it gets crazy lonely with no neighbors or visitors but she has it better than a lot of folks gratitude she said that s what the topic should be next time or how about grit now that s a topic i could get behind these meetings were impossible on the mountain the signal too sketchy unless you were 200 yards up the road mark though could get the news he wanted on his cell phone where he learned how the weather system was being manipulated and wars were brewing and evil people were plotting in windowless rooms in places like the mountains of switzerland the banking system was also about to fail so they needed to get their money from the bank and he would wear it in a money belt around his waist he says it s going to be like y2k mom told me i pointed out that that was a nothing burger she cracked up at the phrase delighted you should tell him that when you get home i said hey mark chill out it s all just a big fat juicy nothing burger we laughed so hard mom spat out her tea during mom s therapy appointment i waited at a nearby starbucks but having seen dianna myself i could imagine it well i was sure mom was immediately soothed by the serene decor of the office the low bubbling tank with its gently swaying fish the lavender palette and soft couch pillows dianna a statuesque blonde in her early 60s was always dressed in flowy silk outfits in muted colors like dusty rose and light gold her large eyes brimmed with wise compassion yet to me she had dispensed firm sometimes uncomfortable insights they were just what i needed later at home i asked mom how it went well she was really dramatic how so she diagnosed us with folie deux she chuckled a little then sighed it s a real diagnosis but ridiculously rare i think i ve heard of it i knew from my french that it meant madness of two according to dianna mark and i are nuts and i need to get off the mountain she told me and here mom paused for a beat one day you will die from this i took that in my chest tight it felt like dianna had reduced all of my fears into one blunt sentence the one i could never bring myself to say to my mother wow i took a deep breath she s very smart you know and experienced what do you think of what she said well again it was a bit dramatic i ll have to think about it are you going to tell mark probably that night after she went to bed i spent hours researching folie deux i was sucked into a twilight world of deadly codependency that leads to insanity suicide murder i learned that folie deux is an indeed rare but actual diagnosis in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm iv where it is referred to as shared psychotic disorder in which one person develops delusions that mirror another person s delusions due to a close long term relationship like a marriage if three people share the delusion it s a folie trois other factors include financial challenges and it is highly correlated with people who are isolated outsiders i felt an odd mix of sorrowful vindication this was what had been happening to them for decades then reading further i locked on to one of the four subtypes of this disorder folie induite imposed psychosis unlike folie simultan e simultaneous psychosis where both people are equally delusional with folie induite one patient takes on another s delusion a flood of memories enveloped me of mom defending mark s dreams of her insisting that most people just will not admit that they envy the freedom she and mark have that their lives are wondrous and worth the deprivation and sacrifice that mark was very wise and knowledgeable i searched for treatment how are these people helped one line crushed me due to the rarity of this disorder presenting in a clinical setting the clinical course and prognosis are not fully understood a few months later i headed up for a visit sleeping in a tent since there was not enough room in the cabin mom was proud to show me a sign they had carved and painted giving their place a name with a mocking acceptance folie a deux i took a picture of them in front of it it was clear to me that mom had chosen her life with mark come what may and i had to accept her choice two years later by the time mark relented to see a doctor cancer had spread much too far he died a few weeks later my mother had a crippling stroke and now lives in a nursing home the injury damaged her emotional center so life for her is that of a strange contentment i visit her every week and push her in the wheelchair down the shady street she loves the trees and sometimes we just stop and rest beneath their reaching branches and shifting shadows below us the roots dig down deep into the earth grasping and holding on for dear life

people often say things like i don t need to understand technology because the computer does it for me at first this might seem practical after all most tools today are designed to be user friendly you might even think that you never learned how a calculator works but you still use it well but imagine if you had not learned the foundation of math that made the calculator so useful in the first place how would that have impacted you in unforeseen ways it is not that different with any form of technology there is just more technology to learn smartphones recognize your face cars guide you with gps and software often works with a simple click but this belief of thinking it is not necessary to know things shuts down curiosity and limits workplace innovation in my research on curiosity the over and under utilization of technology turned out to be one of the key inhibitors of curiosity when employees avoid even a basic understanding of technology they miss chances to explore solve problems and innovate believing technology is not necessary to know often creates hidden costs that show up later and add up to much more than people realize employees who only skim the surface of tools miss opportunities to improve efficiency they may rely on default settings instead of customizing features or they may repeat manual tasks that could be automated over time these choices slow progress and hurt workplace innovation curiosity about how tools work fuels new ideas even basic knowledge helps employees ask better questions connect concepts and find creative solutions that benefit the organization when people accept technology as something that just works they give up the chance to think critically critical thinking is going to become one of the biggest differentiators between humans and ai and a key to being employable in the future before ai makes a bigger impact it is already important to think critically a manager who never explores how a database functions may miss a new way to track customer needs a teacher who avoids learning even simple ai tools might miss creative ways to engage students a doctor who overlooks how data flows through systems may miss insights that improve patient care innovation comes from being curious enough to understand technology at work in order to create the next big idea and work in the most efficient and engaged way artificial intelligence has already changed the way work gets done from customer service chatbots to tools that analyze massive amounts of data ai can speed up processes and improve accuracy but ai is only as effective as the people who use it when employees assume they do not need to understand how ai works they miss the opportunity to spot errors challenge outcomes or think creatively about new applications studies show that ai can make mistakes or reflect biases in the data it learns from without curiosity about how ai reaches its results employees may blindly accept answers that are flawed on the other hand employees who ask questions about how ai functions and how to apply it responsibly help their organizations gain a real competitive advantage workplace innovation in the ai era will belong to those who are curious not just those who are compliant leaders have the ability to shift culture from avoidance to exploration they can when leaders model curiosity employees feel safer to explore and less likely to dismiss technology as unnecessary this creates a culture where workplace innovation thrives employees who want to challenge the belief that technology is not necessary to know can take small but meaningful steps these actions reduce the mystery that surrounds technology and help employees see it as an ally for workplace innovation technology literacy is becoming as essential as reading and math just as you do not need to be a novelist to benefit from reading you do not need to be a coder to benefit from understanding technology basics when employees avoid learning because they believe it is not necessary they create dependence on others and limit their own growth workplace innovation requires curiosity and curiosity requires a willingness to understand the tools that shape today s work the belief that technology is not necessary to know is one of the biggest barriers to curiosity avoiding learning might feel efficient in the moment but it blocks the path to growth by encouraging curiosity leaders and employees can move beyond surface level use and unlock the full potential of the tools around them every step toward understanding strengthens confidence sparks creativity and builds resilience when curiosity replaces avoidance workplace innovation becomes the natural outcome in an era where technology evolves daily those who question learn and adapt will not only keep up but lead the way

skywatchers who get up early on monday sept 16 2025 and have a clear sky will see a conjunction of a beautiful crescent moon and jupiter with two bright stars very close by castor and pollux two bright stars relatively close to the sun are known as the twins of the constellation gemini the four objects will look at their best about 90 minutes before sunrise across north america on the morning of monday sept 16 2025 look low in the east before dawn a waning crescent moon around 28 lit will look spectacular just a degree from jupiter either to the naked eye or through binoculars just to the left of the moon will be the stars castor above and pollux below with all four forming a flattened diamond shape as seen from north america from europe the moon will be a little higher in the sky creating a more pronounced diamond shape each of the four objects the moon jupiter castor and pollux will appear to be about four degrees apart that s the width of three fingers held at arm s length all four objects will be visible to the naked eye but will also fit into the field of view of binoculars the crescent moon is a spectacular object in binoculars with the terminator the dividing line between day and night on the moon where to look for shadows and craters it s also worth pointing any pair of binoculars at jupiter to see its largest moons ganymede europa callisto and io these four moons can be easily seen as points of light this pairing of the crescent moon and jupiter makes for a captivating sight but the nearby presence of gemini s famous twin stars will make this an even more beautiful panorama to the moon s lower left orange tinted pollux just 34 light years from the solar system will act as one corner of the diamond slightly above it to the moon s upper left lies yellowish castor which is about 51 light years distant binoculars may provide a sharper view of the contrast in color between castor and pollux
in the quiet revolution happening at the intersection of artificial intelligence and disability support we re witnessing something exciting technology finally keeping pace with human ingenuity the 1 5 billion people worldwide living with disabilities are not just beneficiaries of this transformation they re driving it reshaping how we think about capability autonomy and the very definition of what it means to be human in an increasingly digital world the psychological impact of this shift cannot be overstated for too long assistive technology has been clunky stigmatizing and one size fits all but ai is changing that narrative offering personalized solutions that adapt to individual needs rather than forcing individuals to adapt to technology s limitations this represents more than technological progress it s a radical reimagining of human potential through a hybrid lens which harnesses the complementarity of natural and artificial assets to their respective full extent consider polly an ai powered device developed by former nasa engineer david hojah through his company parrots inc designed to fit onto wheelchairs polly uses machine learning to provide real time voice assistance cognitive support and telecare solutions that learn from each interaction this isn t just about convenience it s about cognitive sovereignty allowing users to maintain independence while receiving the support they need the educational landscape is experiencing similar breakthroughs ai driven tools like conversational agents predictive text and personalized learning platforms are supporting students with cognitive speech or mobility disabilities by adapting to user preferences and learning from interactions these systems don t just accommodate difference they celebrate it creating learning environments that respond to neurodiversity as a strength rather than a deficit perhaps most remarkably ai is revolutionizing communication access speech to text transcription sound identification and audio separation technologies are breaking down barriers for people with hearing loss while visual recognition systems are providing unprecedented independence for those with vision impairments microsoft s partnership with be my eyes exemplifies this approach using high quality disability representative data to improve ai accuracy and reduce bias the ripple effects extend far beyond individual users caregivers family members and healthcare providers are finding that ai powered assistive technologies reduce their emotional and physical burden while improving care quality smart monitoring systems can track health metrics predict potential issues and provide early interventions allowing caregivers to focus on human connection rather than constant vigilance integrated ai assistants are moving beyond standalone apps to provide seamless intuitive support that feels natural rather than clinical this shift represents a psychological breakthrough for caregivers who often struggle with the tension between wanting to help and fearing they re enabling dependency ai systems that promote autonomy while ensuring safety resolve this dilemma beautifully the next stage are apps that offer a 360 approach addressing the wellbeing of the caregiver and those in their care 24 7 however the path forward isn t without its pitfalls the same ai systems designed to liberate can also marginalize if not carefully designed tools like sentiment analysis and toxicity detection models often exhibit biases toward people with disabilities perpetuating harmful stereotypes embedded in training data as shown by r esearch from penn state more concerning studies show that ai systems like chatgpt demonstrate bias against disability related resumes potentially limiting employment opportunities for those who most need technological support to level the playing field the cruel irony is that the very systems designed to promote inclusion can inadvertently reinforce exclusion privacy concerns loom large as well ai systems require vast amounts of personal data to function effectively raising questions about who controls this information and how it might be used for a community that has historically faced discrimination the surveillance potential of ai assistive technologies represents a genuine threat to autonomy and dignity there s also the risk of over reliance while ai can provide incredible support it shouldn t replace human judgment or community connection the goal isn t to create ai dependent individuals but to use technology as a bridge to greater human engagement and self determination while all of these examples are interesting illustrations of prosocial ai in practice the double beauty of this transformation lies in its economic sustainability the global assistive technology market is projected to reach 26 8 billion by 2024 driven not just by moral imperatives but by genuine market demand companies like microsoft google and apple aren t investing in accessibility features out of charity they recognize that inclusive design creates better products for everyone consider how closed captioning originally developed for deaf and hard of hearing users now benefits millions in noisy environments or when audio isn t available voice recognition technology refined through work with speech disabilities powers virtual assistants used by billions this pattern repeats across industries designing for disability drives innovation that benefits all users the european ai act s emphasis on accessibility signals that regulatory frameworks are catching up with this reality companies that prioritize inclusive ai aren t just doing good they re positioning themselves for long term success in an increasingly regulated landscape as we are opening this new chapter of technological capability and human need 4 principles should guide our approach adapt with purpose ai systems must be designed for personalization not standardization every individual brings unique needs preferences and strengths technology should flex to fit these differences rather than forcing conformity build with community the disability community must be centered in design processes not consulted as an afterthought nothing about disabled people should be created without disabled people and this principle becomes even more critical when dealing with ai systems that can perpetuate or challenge existing biases learn continuously ai systems should be designed for ongoing learning and improvement with feedback loops that allow for real time adjustments based on user experience this isn t just about technical optimization it s about creating systems that grow with their users ensure equity access to ai powered assistive technologies shouldn t depend on economic privilege the most transformative innovations mean nothing if they re available only to those who can afford them this requires intentional effort to ensure broad accessibility and

after years of operational struggles southwest airlines has reclaimed its throne as the best performing u s carrier the dallas based carrier topped the 2025 airline quality rating aqr proving that sometimes the old school approach to airline service still works while southwest was fixing its problems former industry darling delta air lines was busy creating new ones the atlanta carrier plummeted from first place in 2022 to seventh in 2024 the biggest drop of any major airline southwest is the only airline that improved every measure every year from 2022 to 2024 says andrea irish an assistant professor at embry riddle aeronautical university s prescott campus who now authors the annual report they earned the number one rank by actually getting better at everything the 2025 airline quality rating now in its 34th year uses government data to rank airlines on what matters most to passengers on time arrivals baggage handling bumping passengers off flights and customer complaints this year s results covering 2023 and 2024 which were shared exclusively with forbes will be released tomorrow 1 southwest airlines 0 03 2 alaska airlines 0 79 3 hawaiian airlines 0 86 4 allegiant airlines 1 43 5 united airlines 1 89 6 jetblue airways 2 29 7 delta air lines 2 56 8 spirit airlines 3 21 9 american airlines 3 33 10 frontier airlines 6 27 the aqr uses a weighted formula that combines all four performance metrics into a single score higher scores are worse so for example southwest s winning score of 0 03 was dramatically better than last place frontier s 6 27 southwest s rise to the top marks a dramatic return to form after its december 2022 operational meltdown which canceled 16 900 flights stranded 2 million passengers and resulted in a record 140 million fine that crisis exposed the airline s outdated operations but also forced a reckoning leading to a deliberate company wide mindset change according to justin jones southwest s executive vice president of operations the strategy was simple but effective focus on running the operation with as high a completion factor as we possibly could to ensure schedule predictability it was backed by a massive investment of over 1 5 billion targeting winter operations cross team collaboration and technology resilience jones detailed new de icing equipment dedicated crews and a central dashboard so all departments can see in real time how their decisions impact the entire network the results speak for themselves the airline improved its on time performance from 73 2 percent in 2022 to 78 6 percent in 2024 slashed denied boardings and posted the industry s lowest complaint rate 1 71 per 100 000 passengers despite this operational success jones acknowledges a new challenge a perception gap fueled by the airline s recent introduction of fees for checked bags while the policy hasn t harmed operational metrics it has increased stress in customer employee interactions at the gate jones says southwest has a plan to close the gap we re going to make sure that our policies and procedures match our customer service priority he says noting that the goal is to improve the experience without resorting to the aggressive enforcement tactics common on other carriers delta s customer service collapse may be the report s most surprising revelation the airline that was once the gold standard for service saw its complaint rate more than triple from 2 66 per 100 000 passengers in 2022 to 10 01 in 2024 what happened despite maintaining solid on time performance consistently over 80 percent for all three years customer complaints skyrocketed from 2022 through 2024 delta moved from first to seventh which is the biggest drop of any airline irish notes delta blames a global it outage last summer for its performance problems in july 2024 cybersecurity company crowdstrike sent a faulty update to its security program which crashed microsoft windows computers running the software about 8 5 million systems were taken down reportedly one of the largest outages in the history of it an estimated 500 000 passengers were affected and the incident cost delta 550 million in lost revenue and expenses we ve been focused on safe stable on time operations with bags and with a memorable experience for our customers a delta spokesman says he added that delta s most recent performance metrics which are not part of the aqr report have shown a significant improvement for frequent flyers delta s scores represent a seismic shift the airline built its reputation on premium service and reliability now it s struggling with basics like customer service the aqr also singled out alaska airlines as the steadiest performer in the industry it s the only airline of the 10 domestic airlines that has consistently scored in the top 2 for all the years finishing second in 2024 hawaiian airlines meanwhile proved why it s historically dominated the on time performance category the carrier posted the best punctuality record in 9 of the last 10 years frontier airlines remains stuck at the bottom for the third straight year the denver based budget carrier posted the worst on time performance 69 5 percent the highest denial rate 2 25 per 10 000 passengers and the most customer complaints 25 65 per 100 000 passengers frontier did not respond to a request for a comment frontier is the only airline of the 10 airlines to remain in the same rank 10th for all three reporting years irish says that s consistency but not the good kind american airlines the worst ranked legacy carrier isn t far behind it ranked ninth overall with the industry s worst baggage handling record for three consecutive years the airline carrier mishandled 0 84 bags per 100 checked nearly double southwest s rate so are airlines providing better customer service the answer is a resounding no excluding the pandemic the 2024 aqr score is the second lowest ever overall performance improved in some areas on time arrivals rose from 73 percent in 2022 to 76 5 percent in 2024 and baggage handling got better too but customer complaints surged across the board jumping from 7 39 per 100 000 passengers in 2022 to 9 19 in 2024 passenger volumes have returned to pre pandemic levels 774 8 million passengers flew in 2024 up from 752 8 million in 2023 but airlines haven t scaled their service quality accordingly in other words they can get your plane off the ground on time but they can t answer your call or resolve your problem without generating a complaint the complaints went way up and that s highlighting ongoing negative consumer sentiment despite operational gains irish explains the aqr report s credibility comes from its objective approach unlike other customer satisfaction surveys the airline quality rating exclusively uses government data that airlines must report monthly the aqr system uses a multifactor weighted average approach to assess airline quality drawing on publicly available data from the u s department of transportation over the years the government s reporting requirements have changed which makes historical comparisons a little tricky for example in 2022 the government changed how it reports mishandled baggage from losses per passenger to losses per 100 checked bags this gives a more accurate picture of your risk when checking a bag to maintain comparability the weights assigned to these criteria have been held constant still the customer service trend is unmistakable if you have a choice of airline and let s be honest you often don t book a flight on southwest the carrier s service turnaround is real and it shows in every metric that matters alaska is your second best bet offering consistent performance across the board you might want to think carefully before booking a ticket on frontier the ultra low cost model clearly isn t providing customer satisfaction even if the fares look cheap and american s baggage problems make it risky for anyone checking bags as for delta the airline s fall from grace should worry anyone with loyalty to the brand until it fixes its customer service problems that premium you re paying for a ticket isn t buying you premium treatment the latest airline quality rating suggests the u s airline industry s recovery from the pandemic has been uneven some air carriers learned the right lessons others are still figuring it out your wallet and your customer service experience will depend on knowing the difference

out on the cricket fields at the los angeles equestrian center an experiential open air event is bringing together dance sound light puppetry costume myth and robotic canines the show is called the cort ge and now that you ve glimpsed that word don t be surprised when it stalks you across your feeds all week the cort ge bills itself as a revival of the lost art of pageantry and a festive funeral for our times yet like mortality itself with its serpentine tangle of feelings and contradictions this three hour odyssey summons responses ranging from the genuinely transcendent to the deeply confounded from the wowing to the just plain nope and so i invite you to enjoy these multiple perspectives on a journey of drum and drone of crawling creeps and krumpers and of slack jawed wonder at the sight of shaggy wraiths and gargantuans taking the field like escaped car wash brushes with towering hirsute puppets visualize the love children of yo gabba gabba and big foot and ornately costumed musicians and dancers the cort ge delivers a one of a kind all in spectacle that its creator jeff hull an oakland artist and producer known for his streetwear line oaklandish calls shadow work on a cultural scale the audience gathers at twilight sitting on the grass or on raised chairs and a live six piece band begins with an overture of mournful contemplative music a lone silent figure appears crawling and then standing and then dancing at the center of the field he stays there through much of the performance like an anchor or witness while the life of the show plays out around him what follows is a surreal non linear passage through the stages of life and death costumed characters move in dreamlike sequences drones light up the burbank sky robotic dogs and militant imagery stand in for violence and human invention turned destructive there are visual references to refugees immigrants medieval morality plays new orleans funerals the crowd takes it all in wearing headphones with green lights turning the night into a kind of silent disco in a scene straight out of mad max the final act invites the audience to step into the procession to dance and eventually share in a tea reception a symbolic afterlife party held in an an adjoining tent for all its grand ambitions and notable budget the cort ge often feels like a fabulous pinterest board come to life rather than a coherent performance scenes don t so much unfold as collide moments of romantic play give way to flashes of authoritarian force broken up by thumping edm the production stitches together a grab bag of global references caribbean steel drums mardi gras second lines la street dance without ever rooting itself in a specific tradition are we in a bedouin caravan an african ritual a greek amphitheater clue baklava is the lone sweet at the pricey snack stand some directorial choices feel curiously off key why entrust the ritual cleansing of the space to what appears to be a crew member when a dozen costumed shamans stand at the ready nearby and was it necessary for the evening s sole spoken passage to catalog dead celebs including loni anderson and val kilmer meanwhile the headphones meant to unify the audience in a shared soundscape instead isolate viewers into their glowing silos which feels like an ironic choice for a show supposedly about communal grief the result is less a rite of passage than a series of disconnected tableaux dazzling in flashes but never adding up to anything deeper what could have been a transformative meditation on mourning too often slips into surface level spectacle leaving the audience to piece together meaning from a scattershot collage of influences like it or not instagram and tiktok are reshaping how we experience entertainment even in airplane mode from immersive van gogh exhibitions and secret cinema to the recently remounted the willows here in los angeles we flock to these events claiming we want to escape our phones yet these productions are increasingly designed around an ethos of visual over depth that compels us to immediately document and post each scene we experience the show through our cameras i did it too tag our friends and anyone who glimpses our stories gets caught in the algorithm as you now will be with the cort ge so while it s wonderful to venture out into the san fernando valley night and gather with strangers i find myself longing for something that truly raises goosebumps and pulls me so completely into a gripping narrative i forget to perform my own spectatorship the cort ge often feels like a beautiful but diluted version of experiences that cirque du soleil and burning man execute with more conviction and coherence maybe you ll feel differently the los angeles times loved it but still the best entertainment does more than get you to go whoa it makes you forget we have phones to check stories to post feeds to curate it reminds us what it feels like to be genuinely moved rather than momentarily tickled the cort ge gestures toward that transcendence but too often settles for the kind of veiled enchantment that follows us home through our screens also from forbes
netflix dropped the first trailer for fantasy series the witcher s fourth season saturday evening this is our first glimpse of liam hemsworth as geralt of rivia actually in action we ve seen plenty of set photos but now we get to watch the new monster hunter actually fight a monster specifically a wraith it sounds like season 3 will once again follow our heroes on separate journeys the logline reads after the continent altering events of season 3 geralt yennefer and ciri find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies as their paths diverge and their goals sharpen they stumble on unexpected allies eager to join their journeys and if they can accept these found families they just might have a chance at reuniting for good here s the trailer netflix also announced that all eight episodes of season 4 will drop on october 30th just in time for halloween toss a coin to your witcher costume designers my journey as geralt of rivia has been filled with both monsters and adventures and alas i will be laying down my medallion and my swords for season 4 previous witcher star henry cavill posted to his instagram account back in 2022 prior to the third season s release in my stead the fantastic mr liam hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the white wolf this was followed by one of the weirdest marketing campaigns i ve ever seen for a tv show with netflix putting up billboards that said he s still geralt as advertisements for season 3 which was split into two parts to make matters worse one of the show s producers blamed american viewers for the dumbing down of the show s script cavill has big shoes to fill he was not only the perfect casting choice for geralt he was also a huge fan of the books and video games upon which this show is rather loosely based officially it s based on the books only but everything from the aesthetic to the orchestral score bears the fingerprints of cd projekt red s far superior games still hemsworth looks like he ll do a fine job as our gruff mutant warrior protagonist even though it will be hard to accept a casting change four seasons into the show that s not hemsworth s fault it s just a pretty massive change especially when the rest of the cast will remain the same anya chalotra yennefer of vengerberg freya allan princess cirilla of cintra joey batey jaskier will all return for the fourth season i m still curious how or whether a transformed geralt will be explained in the story the bigger problem is with the adaptation itself series creator lauren schmidt hissrich has made numerous changes to the source material very few of which pleased fans or made much sense season 3 was particularly egregious leading many viewers to speculate that cavill s departure was due to creative differences i enjoyed the first season warts and all but you could already see the cracks forming in season 2 and the third cemented my souring opinion of the series this should have been a major hit for netflix but viewership dropped by an estimated 48 from the first to third season an exodus similar to the downward spiral of other big fantasy shows like the wheel of time and rings of power both on amazon prime video it seems unlikely that these trends will reverse cavill s exit didn t sit well with many already disenchanted fans i ll be watching and hoping for the best prepare for the worst hope for the best this is the way season 4 lands on october 30th and will be followed by a fifth and final season in related witcher news the fourth game in the cdpr series is currently in development and features ciri as the playable protagonist p s if you want to watch a really good and genuinely hilarious version of the witcher check out viva la dirt league s series of witcher sketches despite a massively lower budget the writing is much better and the special effects really aren t too shabby here s an example and another you can watch more here

maybach has delivered one of the finest roadsters on earth for a romantic moonlight drive room for two a supple ride a gorgeous view over a curved hood perfect flow of air up and over the windshield and cockpit with virtually no backsplash to disrupt pleasant conversation and the ability at any time to experience a rush of power and speed when the moment calls sounds of the deep burbly bass baritone exhaust dancing atop the engine s upper intake sounds in the treble clef utterly magnificent as the most luxurious evolution of amg s sl 63 maybach sl 680 proves the truth of that old song every girl s crazy bout a sharp dressed man wherever this car travels people double take and triple take at stoplights on the grand boulevards of los angeles i had people rolling down windows to engage in conversation to lean out to better gape at the white leather and carpet of the open cockpit maybach sl sneaks up mentally on people because it s not obvious like a mid engine hypercar wedge it s subtle until the onlookers process and then the double takes begin wherever you go you own the scene maybach sl was born for sunset boulevard inside the rear jump seats are removed replaced with a leather lined parcel shelf no gain in legroom but sl offers ample shoulder leg and foot room for men seven or eight inches beyond the u s median height maybach sl has the same pair of flatscreens and touchscreen logic found in the amg sl but with unique graphics note the rose gold surrounds of the analog style gauges the multi layered top performs its sequenced in less than the time spent awaiting a left turn arrow if only this car had arrived a few months later during one of our brief bouts of winter rain nothing better than putting down the top and driving beautiful roads just after the rain stops and the air is powerfully charged by the nearby ocean scrubbed clean anyone in california or miami will understand maybach s steering wheel is massively proportioned a big hoop reminding of wheels in my 1940s 50s and 60s luxury cars but maybach sl has well sorted mercedes controls on the left and right spars allowing thumb press and finger tip control of a range of functions just like in any mercedes just german reason and logic mercedes maybach manufaktur atelier offers over 50 colors and a range of interiors which can be found on the mercedes amg sl web pages amg s finely laid out multi link sl suspension has unique maybach calibration with softer springs and plusher values to the 2 valve dampers shock absorbers particularly when set to the maybach only suspension powertrain calibration the car just glides even over the horrible roads of southern california set to sport maybach sl attacks curved freeway onramps or 2 lanes with style this is not a wallowing cruiser that isolates the driver in a leather cocoon floating along not entirely sure where the front end is maybach sl is a highly sophisticated but jaunty little roadster that can play sporty but is best in the maybach calibration setting wafting with style hustling along driver melds with the car a little bit of history the original maybach logo was introduced in 1918 when the firm reorganized and rebranded as maybach motorenbau or maybach motor construction in the 21st century the logo has been slightly simplified and means mercedes maybach why the connection to mercedes well the very first maybach prototype car was built with a mercedes daimler chassis and a maybach aero engine maybach built a limited number of grand and powerful cars throughout the roaring twenties but karl maybach s greatest contribution to the wonders of european civilization were his enormously powerful diesel engines that gave birth to the very first high speed trains of europe emphatically putting steam trains out of business his designs were built under license by bristol for use in british passenger trains too after the passing of karl maybach his company was fully absorbed into daimler mercedes benz in the 1960s and maybach mercedes rail engines were produced till 1966 unlike other ultra luxury brands that were reconstituted in the past few decades under new ownership maybach has intimate century long ties with its mother mercedes benz maybach s 4 liter twin turbo v8 is built on amg s one man one engine niche assembly line the engine produces a creamy 577 horsepower between 5500 and 6500 rpm and 590 lb ft of torque from 2500 to 5000 rpm power is delivered through a 9 speed transmission and fully variable all wheel drive system for those obsessed with specs charts yes maybach sl 680 is a slower out of the blocks than the highly athletic amg sl 63 but there s a reason no sport calibration which means no launch control scripting i always remind people that launch control in any german or italian supercar is computer controlled violence and i doubt many maybach owners would ever use it i doubt many amg sl owners use it except to show off for a friend i only use launch control once or twice in any test car in sport maybach sl is nearly as quick in a straight line as its amg brother maybach delivers 4 seconds flat like a swimmer

of the roughly 8 000 players who have appeared in one national hockey league game since the league debuted in 1917 just 404 have reached 1 000 nhl games played that s about five percent quite an exclusive club within the best hockey league in the world with the 2025 26 nhl season set to begin on oct 7 ten players who are currently under contract are less than 50 games away from triggering their silver stick celebrations a handful of others could also reach the milestone before the end of the year here s a closer look at the players who are nearest to the precipice after 15 seasons with three different teams henrique could get to 1 000 before the end of october with the edmonton oilers a trustworthy two way center henrique has been to the stanley cup final with the oilers in the last two seasons as a rookie in 2011 12 he scored the game 6 overtime winner against the new york rangers that advanced the new jersey devils to the stanley cup final heading into 2025 26 nine players from henrique s 2008 draft class have reached 1 000 games he s going into the final year of a two year deal with edmonton which carries a cap hit of 3 million seguin leads his draft class with 809 career points and is set to become the third player from the group to hit 1 000 games following jeff skinner and cam fowler he could have hit the milestone sooner but was limited to just 20 games last season after electing to undergo hip surgery that got him ready in time for the playoffs with the dallas stars a stanley cup winner as a rookie with the boston bruins in 2011 seguin returned to the final with the bruins in 2013 and with the stars in the 2020 playoff bubble he has two years remaining on the monster extension that he signed in dallas in 2018 which carries a cap hit of 9 85 million turning 35 on oct 6 kadri is set to become the ninth member of his draft class to reach 1 000 games among his group he sits fifth in both goals 307 and points 710 after 10 tumultuous years with the toronto maple leafs kadri delivered his best campaign with the colorado avalanche in 2021 22 posting 89 points in the regular season and finishing by hoisting the stanley cup he then signed a seven year free agent contract with the calgary flames which carries a cap hit of 7 million per season in 2024 25 kadri scored a career high 35 goals as the resurgent flames fell one point short of reaching the playoffs sharing kadri s birthdate of oct 6 1990 johansson goes into the new season with two fewer games played but the swedish winger has played for three more teams than kadri and his career 517 points are nearly 200 fewer after spending the first nine years of his career with the washington capitals johansson was traded to the new jersey devils in the summer of 2017 just before the caps broke through with their cup win from there he bounced to boston buffalo minnesota and seattle before returning to washington then was dealt back to the wild at the 2023 trade deadline this fall johansson is back in the state of hockey on a one year deal with a cap hit of 800 000 the latest veteran defenseman to seek a stanley cup with the florida panthers on a team friendly contract jeff petry inked a one year deal with gm bill zito on july 1 at this year s league minimum of 775 000 a native of ann arbor mich petry spent three seasons at michigan state university before turning pro and didn t make his nhl debut with the edmonton oilers until a few weeks after his 23rd birthday on dec 28 2010 petry spent the last two seasons back in michigan with the detroit red wings but injuries limited him to 44 games in the 2024 25 season with 14 nhl seasons under his belt in carolina and st louis justin faulk has quietly amassed an impressive career in a pair of somewhat under the radar markets making an early nhl debut for a defenseman at age 19 after one year at the university of minnesota duluth faulk has been steady and versatile throughout his career he has been good for more than 22 minutes per game and over 100 shot blocks per season as well as some offense when called upon a coveted right shot faulk hit 15 goals four times in his career and topped out with 50 points with the blues in 2022 23 arriving in st louis as a free agent just after the team s championship in 2019 faulk has two years remaining on that deal it carries a cap hit of 6 5 million he has just 212 points in his 974 nhl games with five different teams but brenden dillon s approach to 1 000 games is a phenomenal achievement for a defenseman who was never drafted by an nhl team it s not like dillon was developing under the radar either he played four seasons with the whl s seattle thunderbirds between 2007 and 2011 as he finished up his final junior season with 59 points and 139 penalty minutes dillon had grown to 6 foot 3 and 209 pounds he signed a free agent contract with the dallas stars on mar 1 2011 played his first nhl game just over a year later and locked in as a full time nhl player as soon as the league resumed play following the 2012 13 lockout now standing 6 foot 4 and weighing 225 pounds dillon has built a reputation as a hard hitting shot blocking shutdown blueliner who has remained durable despite his physical playing style he s set to join a very small group of undrafted defensemen born since 1960 who have eclipsed 1 000 games mark giordano jamie macoun steve duchesne dan boyle andy greene and grant ledyard dillon is currently in the second year of his most lucrative contract to date a three year deal with a cap hit of 4 million signed with the new jersey devils on july 1 2024 the two european born players on this list both hail from switzerland and they ve played more nhl games than any other players from their homeland nino niederreiter should have a decent amount of runway ahead after he celebrates his 1 000th game this season too the speedy winger entered the nhl as an 18 year old in 2011 and just celebrated his 33rd birthday on sept 8 he has settled in nicely with the winnipeg jets since being acquired as a trade deadline acquisition in 2023 and is now going into the second season of a three year extension that carries a cap hit of 4 million with 480 career points niederreiter never quite popped like scouts would have expected from a fifth overall draft pick more talented swiss players have joined the league behind him but when he retires it will be as one of the top fowards of his era meanwhile roman josi has set the standard as the best swiss born nhl player to date with 724 career points the nashville predators captain is a norris trophy winner three time finalist and fifth in scoring from his 2008 draft class he s also the all time leader in points and games played for the predators as well as the points leader among swiss born players josi would have closed in on 1 000 games last season had he not missed the last 25 games of the year with a concussion which was followed by a pots diagnosis toward the end of the year in an off season interview with a swiss media outlet josi expressed optimism that he d be healthy for the start of this season and be able to skate in his second olympic games next february in italy listed at just 171 pounds when he was drafted first overall in 2011 ryan nugent hopkins jumped straight into the nhl as an 18 year old and never looked back over 14 seasons the versatile forward added 20 plus pounds to his frame and found ways to contribute as the edmonton oilers morphed from also rans to championship contenders in 2022 23 he exploded for 104 regular season points and he has been among the oilers top producers during their recent back to back runs to the stanley cup final with a 24 game lead over brandon saad of the vegas golden knights nugent hopkins is in the pole position to become the first player from the 2011 draft class to reach the 1 000 game milestone it s a testament to his durability and determination along with saad nine other active nhl players can get to 1 000 this season they ll each need 50 games or more to get there forwards alex killorn of the anaheim ducks and charlie coyle of the colorado avalanche are the closest each at 950 games played saad is at 935 and minnesota wild captain jared spurgeon is just behind him at 933 three more players are at 930 games forwards mika zibanejad of the new york rangers and evander kane of the vancouver canucks and defenseman adam larsson from the seattle kraken minnesota defender zach bogosian sits at 929 games played colorado s brock nelson is at 920 and reilly smith of vegas rounds out the list at 919 with almost no margin of error smith will need to appear in 81 of his team s 82 regular season games in order to reach 1 000 nhl games played in 2025 26

another day another pips puzzle for us to solve it s the second to last sunday of summer so make the most of it try to get outside and enjoy the world s natural splendor breathe in those last few gusts of summer and when that s out of the way we have a pips to knock out looking for saturday s pips read our guide right here in pips you have a grid of multicolored boxes each colored area represents a different condition that you have to achieve you have a select number of dominoes that you have to spend filling in the grid you must use every domino and achieve every condition properly to win there are easy medium and difficult tiers here s an example of a difficult tier pips as you can see the grid has a bunch of symbols and numbers with each color on the far left the three purple squares must not equal one another hence the equal sign crossed out the two pink squares next to that must equal a total of 0 the zig zagging blue squares all must equal one another you click on dominoes to rotate them and will need to since they have to be rotated to fit where they belong not shown on this grid are other conditions such as less than or greater than if there are multiple tiles with or signs the total of those tiles must be greater or less than the listed number it varies by grid blank spaces can have anything the various possible conditions are in order to win you have to use up all your dominoes by filling in all the squares making sure to fit each condition play today s pips puzzle here below are the solutions for the easy and medium tier pips after that i ll walk you through the difficult puzzle spoilers ahead let s do a complete walkthrough of today s difficult pips it starts out like this step 1 today s hard pips is clearly a kangaroo you might see it differently of course but i see a kangaroo the best place to start is the kangaroo s tail because the purple group in the tail is three tiles in a row we know that it has to begin with a double domino we have four double dominoes 0 0 1 1 2 2 and 3 3 but based on the orange 10 group next to it we ll need something that has a 5 on one side ruling out 1 s and 2 s so the tail could be either 3 s or 0 s at this point i had to look a bit further to make a judgment call basically if you go with 0 s you can t make the orange 10 work with the green 0 block above it so i went with 3 s i slotted the 3 3 domino at the tip of the tail then the 3 5 domino over into orange 10 the next domino had to be a 5 0 so i placed that from orange 10 up into green 0 i wasn t 100 certain of the next domino but i felt fairly confident that the 0 4 should go from green 0 into the blue 4 tile finally i placed the 0 0 double over in the kangaroo s foot and the 0 2 domino from the foot s blue 0 group up into pink 2 like so step 2 at this point i simply filled in the remaining solo tiles i placed the 1 5 from purple 1 into pink 11 up in the kangaroo s head and the 1 0 domino from the other purple 1 tile into the orange 0 tile then i placed the 6 2 domino from pink 12 into green 3 like so step 3 everything was lining up quite nicely as this point and i was pretty confident that i had everything in the right place i placed the 1 1 domino into the dark blue 2 group the 5 6 domino from orange 8 up into pink 12 and the 1 4 domino from green 3 into blue 9 then i placed the 2 3 domino from dark blue into orange 8 and the 2 2 domino into the remaining dark blue tiles i d filled in the body arm leg and tail and most of the head at this point to finish today s pips i placed the 5 4 domino from blue 9 into the free tile the kangaroo s neck and the 6 4 domino from pink 11 into the last free tile the kangaroo s ear this is the final product this one bounced along nicely it was a bit tricky to figure out what should go in the tail requiring me to map out a couple of steps ahead before committing sometimes you just have to go with something and see how it plays out and possibly clear the board and start fresh but today i was able to get a good handle on what i needed to start with just by checking possibilities a couple moves out how did you do be sure to follow me for all your daily puzzle solving guides tv show and movie reviews and more here on this blog
to the uninitiated disney s theme parks might seem like they are all the same they are famous for their centerpiece castles with themed lands fanning out around them however one breaks the mould more than the rest all but two of disney s parks belong to the mouse and are run by it the exceptions can be found at tokyo disney resort which is owned and operated by specialist local leisure operator the oriental land company the tokyo disneyland park looks like a carbon copy of the magic kingdom at walt disney world in orlando but is home to a few more high tech attractions its neighbor is a whole new world called tokyo disneysea it is the only disney park formed from ports which largely line a lagoon in the middle as this report explained they are comfortably the most realistic and immersive lands that disney has ever developed the venetian themed mediterranean harbour looks so authentic with its ornate arches weathered walls and cypress tree lined streets that my italian friends thought i was actually in venice when i sent them a photo from the park cracked aqueducts hide ride buildings and the streets look lived in as hotel rooms are behind the windows which come complete with shutters of course it s the same with the american waterfront area with its soaring gothic skyscraper full size steam ship and neighboring fish market a cleverly disguised restaurant it looks like the set of a period drama the mermaid lagoon land looks like it has risen up from the depths of the ocean whilst the lost river delta really does look like it is in the middle of a dense jungle even though it is actually just a few minutes walk away from the other lands that immersion is partly thanks to the topography of the park which sits on a reclaimed island just 20 minutes by rail from downtown tokyo in a city where space is at such a premium disney had to think outside the box to fit in its aquatic adventure land unlike almost every other major theme park disneysea is built on multiple levels so there s quite an incline to some of the streets in mediterranean harbour just as there is in actual riviera cities such as san remo and monaco likewise visitors to lost river delta find themselves looking down leafy gorges and climbing wooden stairways up to huts built on stilts over the water the biggest splash is made by a 160 feet artificial volcano in the middle of the park ten 3 000 pound rocket burners hidden inside shoot flames 50 feet into the sky as steam rolls down its stony slopes no stone has been left unturned and there are even real figs growing on its foothills which seem to be formed from solidified lava a path winding around the volcano leads to two of disney s most cutting edge attractions anywhere in the world one simulates an undersea voyage by pumping water through the middle of the double glazed windows of a suspended ride vehicle which weaves through an indoor set the other ride is a cross between a roller coaster and a simulator which shoots out of the side of the volcano reflecting the story of jules verne s journey to the center of the earth last year the park swung open the doors to equally ingenious fairytale rides themed to the frozen tangled and peter pan cartoons one mysteriously manages to replicate the famous floating lanterns scene from tangled while another uses projections to make it seem like animatronic characters are covered in ice roving simulators in the peter pan ride give guests the impression that they are soaring through the skies of london with the boy who never grew up these advanced attractions have put tokyo disney on the radar of foreign theme park fans more than ever before the experience that awaits them is unlike the one found in any other disney park and not just because many of the rides are unique you won t find the following list of differences to other disney parks mentioned in a typical guide book 1 a separate ticket is needed for every day of your visit to tokyo disney multi day tickets were a casualty of covid initially put on hold to carefully control crowd levels they haven t returned since the the pandemic receded as the sale of single day tickets boosts revenue not only do visitors have to specify the date and park they want to visit but they have to pay more as multi day tickets were discounted by between 10 and 20 2 only lottery winners watch the shows many of the shows in tokyo disney operate a lottery system which guests have to enter in order to get a seat if they lose they can t get in no second chances on the same day it s the sort of thing you expect to have to do to get tickets for wimbledon not a mickey mouse musical 3 limited wi fi the digital infrastructure at tokyo disney is weaker than its counterparts elsewhere in the world as wi fi is only available in certain parts of the parks usually near the entrance it s often easy to tell where they are as they are packed with people huddled together staring at their phones 4 no end of the day rush for a final ride unlike most major parks in europe and the united states guests can t join ride queues right up to closing time as the lines are roped off when they extend beyond the operating hours of the park so if tokyo disneyland closes at 9pm and the big thunder mountain roller coaster has a 40 minute wait time by 8 20pm guests aren t allowed to join the queue 5 easier rides in line with japanese tastes many of the rides are much tamer than their equivalents stateside the tower of terror freefall ride even has over the shoulder seatbelts rather than lap restraints as there are in the u s 6 no show remarkably some attractions at tokyo disney still haven t returned since the curtain came down on them during the pandemic the most notable closure in tokyo disneyland is the swiss family treehouse the classic attraction packed guests into paths which wind through an artificial tree based on the one in 1960 movie swiss family robinson the attraction has been closed since 2022 with no sign of it reopening ditto for king triton s concert in tokyo disneysea which is a greater loss as it was the only disney show of its kind worldwide presented in a circular theater it combined puppets screens and an acrobatic performer hanging from above its innovative format is even more advanced than the one used in the new little mermaid show at disney world in orlando 7 language barrier very little english is spoken in tokyo disney and the majority of the rides are in japanese some show operators offer audio translators with headphones to foreign guests and guest relations give them charming printed brochures showing the english back story to a number of the attractions they are more like mementos than guides 8 fast food is off the menu typical fast food options are few and far between at tokyo disney with many of its restaurants serving asian dishes there s no doubt that it s healthier but it s not ideal for anyone with a weak stomach especially when they have been walking around all day surprisingly it s even hard to find a burger in the american waterfront area the land is so well designed that even the food fits the theme and its restaurants are aimed at the well heeled residents who are meant to live there that s what you call authenticity 9 monorail costs getting to the parks isn t child s play a monorail pulls up to their gates in tokyo just like it does at disney world and disneyland in california it is even better themed with its windows and grab handles shaped like mouse ears however unlike its counterparts in the u s it isn t free and tickets cost 2 300 for a single trip 10 cash required despite having a reputation for being at the cutting edge of technological trends cash is king in japan if you don t have a japanese credit card you need to use cash to buy a monorail ticket or rent a locker so tourists should bring a good supply of local notes and coins to ensure they aren t caught out
one of the defining strengths of naval special warfare the navy seal teams was our ability to thrive in a decentralized highly autonomous environment this wasn t optional it was a necessity on the battlefield speed adaptability and trust in your teammates determined survival and success the same principle holds true in the battlefield of business particularly for organizations on the cusp of rapid growth or navigating significant transformation at excelr8 a hybrid enterprise saas and management consulting firm we work with organizations on the cusp of rapid growth or profound transformation across industries and geographies one leadership theme consistently emerges from the data in our ai powered performance and productivity platform a lack of autonomy and effective delegation ranks among the top three employee complaints this is not just a frustration point it s a powerful opportunity for leaders to unlock performance engagement and growth leaders often walk a tightrope between holding the vision and trusting others to carry it forward in the early days of a business near total control is often required founders live in the details because every decision feels existential but as organizations scale the same instinct that once fueled success becomes a liability what worked at ten employees strangles progress at one hundred the data underscores this tension research from harvard business review shows that 58 of leaders struggle to release control of tasks and responsibilities and our own excelr8 insights reveal the downstream effect employees consistently report frustration when leaders fail to empower them creating bottlenecks disengagement and talent attrition the reluctance to delegate is understandable for many leaders their business is more than an enterprise it is an extension of their identity built through sleepless nights financial risk and countless personal sacrifices yet clinging too tightly can block the very growth they seek for example fellow entrepreneur william stern founder of cardiff a small business lender that has facilitated over 10 billion in loans since 2004 shared with me a compelling example of the delegation paradox stern recognized that to scale sustainably he had to move from proving to empowering i was intrigued by this viewpoint as he explains to scale you need your team to put their fingerprints on the mission vision and values and that means delegating outcomes not tasks this shift allowed stern not just to preserve cardiff s dna but to amplify it his leadership demonstrates that letting go doesn t mean losing control it means gaining capacity through others successful delegation is not abdication it is clarity leaders who step back effectively don t vanish they redefine their role from execution to articulation their job becomes communicating the mission so precisely that others can advance it without constant oversight another compelling case for the power of autonomy comes from netflix under reed hastings from its early days netflix embraced a culture of freedom and responsibility codified in its now famous culture deck hastings understood that to innovate at scale leaders had to trust employees with decision making authority rather than bury them under layers of approval this approach empowered teams to move quickly experiment boldly and own their results qualities that proved critical as netflix transitioned from dvd rentals to streaming and later to global content production by granting autonomy and holding people accountable for outcomes hastings created a culture where innovation wasn t the exception but the expectation the results speak for themselves netflix disrupted not just one industry but three dvd distribution streaming technology and original content creation the lesson is clear when leaders delegate authority and trust their teams autonomy becomes a force multiplier for growth innovation and resilience this is what cio world calls leadership alchemy transforming insight into influence and aspiration into scalable action when vision is well defined delegation ceases to be risky it becomes liberating for leaders and for their teams one of the great myths of delegation is that leaders must choose between micromanagement and detachment the reality is more nuanced the most effective leaders stay connected in select high leverage areas those that define brand culture or strategic direction while entrusting others with execution leadership thinker lolly daskal frames it well excellence emerges when you stop proving and start growing build trust through purposeful interactions embrace bold delegation and redefine success through your team s achievements rather than your own the transition from founder led to founder inspired leadership is not a single leap but a continual recalibration leaders must repeatedly ask for some the answer lies in shaping the next product breakthrough for others it is becoming the chief storyteller cultural architect or external ambassador whatever the answer the path to scalable leadership always runs through delegation autonomy and trust the data is clear when leaders fail to delegate they stunt organizational growth and suppress human potential but when they embrace autonomy as a leadership discipline they don t dilute their vision they multiply it that is how leaders scale not just a business but a legacy
yesterday s nintendo direct was arguably one of its best in a good while simply because of the proverbial buffet of promising games additional content and fun amiibo figures shown to eager audiences by the way those kirby air riders amiibo are incredibly skylanders swap force don t you think as litigation happy as nintendo tends to be it s rather funny how they outright swiped swapped ha an entire physical gameplay mechanic from activision s popular toys to life franchise i guess it s only stealing when the plagiarism is related to pok mon although maybe they paid activision for the privilege who knows oh and how could i forget the dang virtual boy is coming back yeah that beautiful red headache machine from 1995 what a time to be alive man metroid prime 4 beyond with its seemingly vast open world moody atmosphere vi o la motorbike and creepy snow wolves could be yet another goty contender when it finally releases on december 4 2025 at the very least it will probably dominate the gaming landscape this holiday season and i can t wait to play it then there s yoshi and the mysterious book slated for a spring 2026 launch the borderline and downright beautiful stop motion animation in this brand new 2d adventure is immediately striking as is the sketch like art direction while it doesn t seem to be a proper sequel to the n64 s beloved yoshi s story much to the dismay of some fans there s a cute storybook to explore all the same and i think this one could be a solid pick for kids and families also presented at yesterday s nintendo direct was fresh dlc for donkey kong bananza entitled dk island emerald rush which is the combination of a bright new hub world to explore as well as a sort of roguelite trial mode wherein you collect green ore while powering up donkey kong with different perks and powers for maximum score and ranking bananza is such a fantastic game probably my own game of the year and it s awesome to see it already receiving additional content i m not even mentioning other cool and anticipation worthy announcements like dragon quest vii reimagined the quirky pok mon pokopia and mario tennis fever with its neat adventure mode there was even a switch 2 version of super mario bros wonder revealed with a real talking flower plus mega dimension dlc locked in for the upcoming pok mon legends z a i do think it s a bit ridiculous showing dlc for a title that hasn t even been released yet i guess we re milking every last potential dollar out of gamers these days even pre dollars but this perhaps wasn t the most egregious presentation nintendo pushed out this pretend award at least according to what people are saying on social media could potentially belong to the remastered collection that s officially called super mario galaxy super mario galaxy 2 this tidy bundle includes the two lauded wii games released in 2007 and 2010 respectively playable on both switch 1080p and switch 2 4k with a free update but only while docked i m assuming the bundle will be available soon on october 2 2025 undoubtedly engineered to start the hype train for an imminent super mario galaxy movie which is due in 2026 but back to the people and their pitchforks la carte the remastered wii titles are priced at 39 99 each while the bundle itself will save you 10 and set you back 69 99 and note that nintendo didn t put these prices in the trailer probably for good reason this has understandably caused some mild uproar among particular gamers one user brought up images of the original wii games when they were re released under the budget nintendo selects line which priced bestselling software at 19 99 or less another person mentioned how these titles were 20 each on the wii u virtual console when that online shop was still active granted this new bundle adds new rosalina storybook chapters to the games improved ui support for upcoming amiibo and a new assist mode for beginners and casual players alike which is sounds reasonable to me plus you get to experience these retro titles in 4k on switch 2 which alone could be worth the price of admission for some gamers i guess what i m saying is that these aren t just straight remasters you do get some decent quality of life updates improved resolution and some extra content to boot let s also not brush aside the fact that these are objectively two of the best 3d platformers ever made with super mario galaxy sitting at a healthy 97 on metacritic and super mario galaxy 2 matching that score with its own beastly 97 are they worth a bundle price of 70 or 80 separately that s a tough one i ll admit make no mistake these aren t remakes so they exist in a gray area and that complicates the price for sure these are mostly the old wii games but now they run at better resolutions and the menus are supposedly better and there s some additional content to explore and of course they run on modern hardware so there s convenience to factor in as well we do love our convenience don t we for comparison s sake though the now somewhat redundant super mario 3d all stars also contained the first super mario galaxy and bizarrely went out of print back in 2021 how a digital game goes out of print i ll never understand but now that we re seeing a new galaxy bundle and with super mario 64 currently available on nso super mario sunshine is coming later too the artificial scarcity makes a kind of twisted sense nintendo can repackage and resell the first galaxy in 2025 and really these kinds of remasters are easy money for publishers from a game preservation standpoint i m all for re releasing the classics on current hardware within reason it makes us retro gamers happy and it exposes younger gamers to the titans of gaming history providing much needed context for the present landscape i do wish nintendo was simply releasing galaxy and galaxy 2 on nso but i get the need to cash in separately i just don t know how many of us old timers will partake given the high prices involved and the availability of the galaxy titles in our own collections many of us still have our wii consoles and dusty copies of these excellent mario games and it s never been simpler to hook up aging hardware to modern televisions yeah you won t get 4k output or the quality of life improvements but it will potentially save you 70 or even 80 in the long run so what do you think has nintendo gone too far with these pricey remasters or are the upgrades worth it let me know in the comments or don t maybe pop some popcorn instead or go read in a park that s good too

rainmaker technology s bid to deploy cloud seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union which has urged the federal aviation administration to consider denying the startup s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines the faa s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward rainmaker s bet on small drones hangs in the balance the air line pilots association alpa told the faa that rainmaker s petition fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety and poses an extreme safety risk however rainmaker ceo augustus doricko said an email that all of the union s objections are based on only the public notice rather than non public documents submitted to the faa that outline all of the company s safety data and risk mitigations rainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials the startup filed in july and the faa has yet to rule instead it issued a follow up request for information pressing for specifics on operations and safety in its filing rainmaker proposed using two flare types one burn in place and the other ejectable on its elijah quadcopter to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation elijah has a maximum altitude of 15 000 feet msl measured from sea level which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly drones need permission from air traffic control to fly inside this bubble rainmaker s petition says it will operate in class g uncontrolled airspace unless otherwise authorized alpa notes the filing doesn t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used however doricko said the documents submitted to the faa disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15 000 feet msl they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination alpa did not reply to techcrunch s requests for comment the union also objects to the flares themselves citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety alpa points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents regarding their objection to the use of flares independent bodies like this administration s epa and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding doricko said sam kim rainmaker s aviation regulatory manager said the company respects the pilot s union and hopes to continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization but claimed the objection shows a lack of understanding of why rainmaker has filed for this exemption our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations kim added doricko said that a typical rainmaker operation disperses 50 100 grams of silver iodide and far less than that in a flight with flares while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics sulfur oxides and soot significantly more material than a rainmaker op rainmaker is interested in doing the best responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide alpa s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our conop all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non public docs that the faa is reviewing now doricko said regarding alpa s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals intentional coordination with local atc certified pilots and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers he said however rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords with whom rainmaker has developed close working relationships cloud seeding already happens today largely in the western u s with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt the general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s by spraying small particles into certain clouds scientists found they could induce precipitation typically cloud seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals when a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super cooled they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point once the ice crystal forms it can grow quickly if conditions are right faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances plus the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation rainmaker s twist doing this work with drones instead of pilots could prove safer in the longer term the company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews over rural areas with other safety checks in place what happens next hinges on whether the faa thinks those mitigations are sufficient however it s decided the agency s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud seeding approaches 9 13 2025 the story has been updated to include rainmaker s comments from augustus doricko founder and ceo and sam kim rainmaker s

california s state senate gave final approval early on saturday morning to a major ai safety bill setting new transparency requirements on large companies as described by its author state senator scott wiener sb 53 requires large ai labs to be transparent about their safety protocols creates whistleblower protections for employees at ai labs creates a public cloud to expand compute access calcompute the bill now goes to california governor gavin newsom to sign or veto he has not commented publicly on sb 53 but last year he vetoed a more expansive safety bill also authored by wiener while signing narrower legislation targeting issues like deepfakes at the time newsom acknowledged the importance of protecting the public from real threats posed by this technology but criticized wiener s previous bill for applying stringent standards to large models regardless of whether they were deployed in high risk environments involved critical decision making or the use of sensitive data wiener said the new bill was influenced by recommendations from a policy panel of ai experts that newsom convened after his veto politico also reports that sb 53 was recently amended so that companies developing frontier ai models while bringing in less than 500 million in annual revenue will only need to disclose high level safety details while companies making more than that will need to provide more detailed reports the bill has been opposed by a number of silicon valley companies vc firms and lobbying groups in a recent letter to newsom openai did not mention sb 53 specifically but argued that to avoid duplication and inconsistencies companies should be considered compliant with statewide safety rules as long as they meet federal or european standards and andreessen horowitz s head of ai policy and chief legal officer recently claimed that many of today s state ai bills like proposals in california and new york risk crossing a line by violating constitutional limits on how states can regulate interstate commerce a16z s co founders had previously pointed to tech regulation as one of the factors leading them to back donald trump s bid for a second term the trump administration and its allies subsequently called for a 10 year ban on state ai regulation anthropic meanwhile has come out in favor of sb 53 we have long said we would prefer a federal standard said anthropic co founder jack clark in a post but in the absence of that this creates a solid blueprint for ai governance that cannot be ignored topics anthony ha is techcrunch s weekend editor previously he worked as a tech reporter at adweek a senior editor at venturebeat a local government reporter at the hollister free lance and vice president of content at a vc firm he lives in new york city founders land your investor and sharpen your pitch investors discover your next breakout startup innovators claim a front row seat to the future join 10 000 tech leaders at the epicenter of innovation register now and save up to 668 regular bird rates end september 26 elon musk s boring company suspends work on vegas airport tunnel after crushing injury spotify is finally launching support for lossless music streaming i want to love apple s new iphone air but the iphone 17 is a better deal iphone 17 iphone air airpods pro 3 and everything else announced at apple s hardware event apple debuts the 999 ultra thin iphone air smart ring maker oura s ceo addresses recent backlash says future is a cloud of wearables openai announces ai powered hiring platform to take on linkedin 2025 techcrunch media llc

president donald trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year s presidential campaign promising an unprecedented number of deportations in his first eight months in office that promise turned into around 350 000 deportations a figure that includes deportations by immigration and customs enforcement around 200 000 customs and border protection more than 132 000 and almost 18 000 self deportations according to cnn ice has taken center stage in trump s mass deportation campaign raiding homes workplaces and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants to aid its efforts the ice has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities here is a recap of some of the technology that ice has in its digital arsenal clearview ai is perhaps the most well known facial recognition company today for years the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet on monday 404 media reported that ice has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm homeland security investigations hsi with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers according to a government procurement database the contract signed last week is worth 3 75 million ice has had other contracts with clearview ai in the last couple of years in september 2024 the agency purchased forensic software from the company a deal worth 1 1 million the year before ice paid clearview ai nearly 800 000 for facial recognition enterprise licenses clearview ai did not respond to a request for comment contact us do you have more information about ice and the technology it uses we would love to learn how this affects you from a non work device you can contact lorenzo franceschi bicchierai securely on signal at 1 917 257 1382 or via telegram and keybase lorenzofb or email you also can contact techcrunch via securedrop in september 2024 ice signed a contract worth 2 million with israeli spyware maker paragon solutions almost immediately the biden administration issued a stop work order putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government s use of commercial spyware because of that order for nearly a year the contract remained in limbo then last week the trump administration lifted the stop work order effectively reactivating the contract at this point it s unclear what s the status of paragon s relationship with ice in practice the records entry from last week said that the contract with parago is for a fully configured proprietary solution including license hardware warranty maintenance and training practically speaking unless the hardware installation and training were done last year it may take some time for ice to have paragon s system up and running it s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ice or hsi an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration but also cover online child sexual exploitation human trafficking financial fraud and more paragon has long tried to portray itself as an ethical and responsible spyware maker and now has to decide if it s ethical to work with trump s ice a lot has happened to paragon in the last year in december american private equity giant ae industrial purchased paragon with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company red lattice according to israeli tech news site calcalist in a sign that the merger may have taken place when techcrunch reached out to paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ice contract last week we were referred to redlattice s new vice president of marketing and communications jennifer iras redlattice s iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article nor for last week s article in the last few months paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in italy where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists in response paragon cut ties with italy s intelligence agencies for years ice has used the legal research and public records data broker lexisnexis to support its investigations in 2022 two non profits obtained documents via freedom of information act requests which revealed that ice performed more than 1 2 million searches over seven months using a tool called accurint virtual crime center ice used the tool to check the background information of migrants a year later the intercept revealed that ice was using lexisnexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime a program that a critic said enabled mass surveillance according to public records lexisnexis currently provides ice with a law enforcement investigative database subscription leids which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations this year ice has paid 4 7 million to subscribe to the service lexisnexis spokesperson jennifer richman told techcrunch that ice has used the company s product data and analytics solutions for decades across several administrations our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data in full compliance with laws and regulations and for the protection of all residents of the united states said richman who added that lexisnexis partners with more than 7 500 federal state local tribal and territorial agencies across the united states to advance public safety and security data analytics and surveillance technology giant palantir has signed several contracts with ice in the last year the biggest contract worth 18 5 million from september 2024 is for a database system called investigative case management or icm the contract for icm goes back to 2022 when palantir signed a 95 9 million deal with palantir the peter thiel founded company s relationship with ice dates back to the early 2010s earlier this year 404 media which has reported extensively on the technology powering trump s deportation efforts and particularly palantir s relationship with ice revealed details of how the icm database works the tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database which allows ice to filter people based on their immigration status physical characteristics criminal affiliation location data and more 404 media cited a source familiar with the database who said it is made up of tables upon tables of data and that it can build reports that show for example people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry who came from a specific country and who have a specific hair color or any number of hundreds of data points the tool and palantir s relationship with ice was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 media an internal wiki where palantir justifies working with trump s ice palantir is also developing a tool called immigrationos according to a contract worth 30 million revealed by business insider immigrationos is said to be designed to streamline the selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens give near real time visibility into self deportations and track people overstaying their visa according to a document

this week openai and oracle shocked the markets with a surprise 300 billion five year agreement part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider s stock skyrocketing but maybe the markets shouldn t have been taken by surprise the deal is a reminder that despite oracle s legacy status the company still plays a major role in ai infrastructure on the openai side the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest for one the startup s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup s appetite even if it s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it chirag dekate a vice president at research firm gartner told techcrunch it s clear why both sides were interested in this deal it makes sense for openai to work with several infrastructure providers he noted it also diversifies the company s infrastructure spreading out risk among several cloud providers and gives openai a scaling advantage compared to competitors openai seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global ai supercomputing foundations for extreme scale inference scaling where appropriate dekate said this is quite unique this is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like some industry watchers expressed surprise that oracle was involved citing the company s diminished role in the ai boom compared to cloud rivals like google microsoft azure and aws but dekate argues that observers shouldn t be so surprised oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for tiktok s sizable u s business over the decades they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure dekate said but even as the stock market celebrates the deal key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain openai has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year each one with an eye popping price tag openai has committed to spend around 60 billion a year for compute from oracle and 10 billion to develop custom ai chips with broadcom meanwhile openai said in june it hit 10 billion in annual recurring revenue up from around 5 5 billion last year that figure includes revenue from the company s consumer products chatgpt business products and its api and while its ceo sam altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers products and revenue the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year power is another question or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute industry observers have been predicting a near term boost for natural gas though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets tech companies are also betting big on nuclear despite market moving headlines the energy impact of openai s anticipated growth isn t entirely unexpected data centers are anticipated to consume 14 of all electricity in the u s by 2040 according to a report the rhodium group published yesterday compute has always been a constraint for ai companies so much so that investors have bought thousands of nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need andreessen horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20 000 gpus while nat friedman and daniel gross rented access to a 4 000 gpu cluster though maybe meta owns that now but compute is worthless without power to ensure their data centers remain juiced large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms buying nuclear power plants and inking deals with geothermal startups so far openai has been relatively quiet on that front ceo sam altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector including oklo helion and exowatt but the company itself hasn t thrown money into the space like google meta or amazon with a 4 5 gigawatt compute deal that may soon change the company may play an indirect role paying oracle to handle the physical infrastructure something it has extensive experience with just as altman invested in startups aligned with openai s future power needs that will leave the company asset light something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software centric ai startups and not with legacy tech firms which are burdened with pricey infrastructure topics senior

the ceo of the largest digital and print publisher in the u s has accused google of being a bad actor for crawling its websites to support the search giant s ai products neil vogel ceo of people inc formerly dotdash meredith a publisher that operates over 40 brands including people food wine travel leisure better homes gardens real simple southern living allrecipes and others said that google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the google search engine as it does to support its ai features google has one crawler which means they use the same crawler for their search where they still send us traffic as they do for their ai products where they steal our content said vogel speaking at the fortune brainstorm tech conference this week he noted that three years ago google search accounted for about 65 of the company s traffic and that has since dropped to the high 20s vogel shared an even more startling statistic with adexchanger last month saying that as of several years ago google s traffic accounted for as much as 90 of people inc s traffic from the open web i m not complaining we ve grown our audience we ve grown our revenue vogel told conference attendees we re doing great what is not right about this is you cannot take our content to compete with us vogel believes publishers need more leverage in the ai era which is why he feels it s necessary to block ai crawlers automated programs that scan websites to train ai systems as that can force them into content deals his company for example has a deal with openai which vogel described as a good actor people inc has been leveraging web infrastructure company cloudflare s latest solution to block ai crawlers that don t pay prompting ai players to approach the publisher with potential content deals while vogel wouldn t directly name the companies involved he said they were large llm providers no deals have been signed yet but vogel said the company is much further along than before it adopted the crawler blocking solution however vogel pointed out google s crawler can t be blocked because doing so would also prevent the publisher s websites from being indexed in google search cutting off that 20 ish of traffic that google still delivers they know this and they re not splitting their crawler so they are an intentional bad actor here vogel declared janice min the editor in chief and ceo at newsletter provider ankler media agreed calling big tech companies like google and meta longtime content kleptomaniacs i don t see the benefit to us in partnering with any ai company right now she said adding that her company blocks ai crawlers meanwhile cloudflare ceo matthew prince whose company makes the ai blocking solution and who was also on the panel said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the ai companies behave he suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations the cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the ai companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law created for the pre ai era was the right answer i think that it s a fool s errand to go down that path because in copyright law typically the more derivative something is the more it s protected under fair use what these ai companies are doing is they re actually creating derivatives prince said and so if you look at the best case law that s come out so far it s actually said that the use by anthropic and others the reason anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for 1 5 billion was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got prince also proclaimed that everything that s wrong with the world today is at some level google s fault because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation triggering publishers like buzzfeed to write for clicks still he admitted that google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint internally they re having massive fights about what they do and my prediction is that by this time next year google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it

software might be eating the world but it s taking some industries longer than others to realize its full potential from iphones to teslas people have grown accustomed to software updates improving the stuff they already own but outside consumer electronics and automobiles over the air updates aren t commonplace yet yet that s beginning to change starting with an unlikely product heat pumps last week heat pump startup quilt said that it pushed an update last week to heat pumps already installed in customers homes it wasn t just a bug fix either the new software and firmware boosted the units heating and cooling capacities overnight by more than 20 from the very beginning we wanted to design the systems to be able to be continuously improved updated over the air it s a pattern that s happened in evs and gotten a lot of traction but no one had really done that before in hvac quilt ceo paul lambert told techcrunch in cars sometimes they call it software defined vehicles we feel like we ve created software defined hvac he added it can be hard to prove a negative but according to heat pump expert drew tozer the update is likely the first of its kind typically when a heat pump is installed or any piece of hvac equipment the only time it s touched is when there s a problem but many on quilt s team didn t come from a traditional hvac background instead they were drawn from nest google apple and tesla companies where frequent updates are the norm isaac mcquillen the engineer who led the capacity increase project worked most recently at lucid motors where he managed heating and cooling for both passengers and batteries we got some feedback from both installation partners and some customers that it d be really useful if we were able to have a slightly higher maximum operating capacity mcquillen said some people had larger living rooms or open floorpans that were more demanding so the team dug in to see if the heat pumps had a little extra to give quilt had specified more and higher quality sensors than what is normally found in residential hvac systems including additional pressures sensors higher accuracy temperature and current sensors mcquillen said that data was key to the project once the team realized they had room to spare they set about testing the new parameters on in house units to validate both performance and reliability quilt s updates included both software and firmware that runs on the main processor and microcontrollers scattered throughout the indoor and outdoor units originally installed the outdoor portion of a quilt heat pump provided up to 19 700 btus of cooling per hour and 20 500 btus of heating per hour now cooling and heating figures have increased to 24 000 btus per hour and 25 200 btus per hour respectively the new ratings don t change how efficiently the heat pumps run but it does allow them to better cope with extreme heat and cold the power of over the air updating doesn t come for free it was only possible because quilt had used higher quality sensors monitored the data more closely and included networking equipment to receive the update they added a small amount to the total bill of materials lambert said but as the company sees it the benefits far outweigh the costs there s the upfront capital cost of the sensors but we think there s just so much value to be gained from that extra data that that we felt that was worth it to integrate them mcquillen said the hard part lambert added is knowing how to build all the integration around it with the software and all the systems working together plus quilt can now sell the units to a broader range of customers without having to design and market an entirely new model sounds like a win win topics senior reporter climate tim de chant is a senior

thanks to a pledge to unbundle its corporate messaging app teams from its productivity suites microsoft has managed to slip unscathed through a major antitrust investigation by the european commission that could have resulted in massive fines for the tech giant the commission on friday okayed microsoft s concessions to address the eu s competition concerns over the company including teams along with the rest of its office productivity suite for free concluding a multi year investigation that was sparked by complaints from rival office messaging app slack in 2020 microsoft has promised that for the next seven years it will provide microsoft 365 and office 365 without teams at a lower price and will let customers choose whether they want to pay more to add the collaboration app to the suites the commission has also managed to get microsoft to agree to open up its apis to enable interoperability for key features between its suite and third party messaging and collaboration tools as well as let them export their data out of teams for the next five years in its investigation the european authority accused microsoft of breaching competition rules by bundling teams with its productivity suites abusing its dominant position and granting teams an undue advantage in its preliminary findings the commission also said that advantage was improved because teams was integrated with other microsoft 365 apps like excel outlook sharepoint and word microsoft attempted to allay those concerns by implementing a partial unbundling of teams in april 2024 but the commission felt more extensive changes were needed following which the company offered a revised plan in may 2025 this approval is a win win for both the eu and microsoft especially because there was no legal battle the commission can say it s wrung a big compromise from big tech now microsoft is voluntarily offering some versions of both its productivity suites without teams at a 50 lower price compared to versions that bundle the app worldwide and microsoft dodged punitive measures and a big fine as the commission s penalties for breaching competition rules can reach up to 10 of annual global revenue which considering the tech giant last year recorded 245 billion in revenue would have been truckloads of money we appreciate the dialogue with the commission that led to this agreement and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully nanna louise linde vice president of european government affairs at microsoft said in an emailed statement the commission also noted that slack and alfaview another company that had complained about teams have withdrawn their complaints following a market test by the commission earlier this year with today s decision we make binding for seven years or more microsoft s commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with teams teresa ribera executive vice president for clean just and competitive transition at the european commission said in a statement today s decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs said ribera note this story was updated to add a comment by microsoft topics editor ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor he covered north american and european m a equity regulatory news and debt markets at reuters and acuris global and has also written about travel tourism entertainment and books you can contact or verify outreach from ram by emailing ramiyertc gmail com founders land your investor and sharpen your pitch investors discover your next breakout startup innovators claim a front row seat to the future join 10 000 tech leaders at the epicenter of innovation register now and save up to 668 regular bird rates end september 26 elon musk s boring company suspends work on vegas airport tunnel after crushing injury spotify is finally launching support for lossless music streaming i want to love apple s new iphone air but the iphone 17 is a better deal iphone 17 iphone air airpods pro 3 and everything else announced at apple s hardware event apple debuts the 999 ultra thin iphone air smart ring maker oura s ceo addresses recent backlash says future is a cloud of wearables openai announces ai powered hiring platform to take on linkedin 2025 techcrunch media llc
when seth winterroth left his job at ge ventures to help launch eclipse in 2015 robotics was on his mind or more specifically the number of early stage robotics startups that were struggling to launch due to lack of interest these are teams that had just finished their postdocs at waterloo or cmu or mit and were starting robotics companies and the refrain that i continually heard from the startups was hey we re having a really hard time raising institutional venture capital winterroth told techcrunch at the time in silicon valley most venture capital was going into the very mature application layer or the application layer of some very mature computing platforms a lot has changed since then now after investing in robotics startups for 10 years winterroth a partner at eclipse said the time to invest in robotics has never been better the robotics startup market has matured and the hardware and software powering these bots has gotten significantly better and cheaper venture investing in the category is gaining momentum as well investors poured 6 billion into robotics startups in the first seven months of 2025 according to crunchbase data the data company predicts that this year s funding totals will eclipse 2024 making it one of the only non ai categories to experience a boost in funding while one could argue that robotics is seeing a surge in investor interest because of ai and it s not wrong to acknowledge ai s role in the advancement of robotic tech investors who have focused on the category longer than the last few years said the industry didn t get to this point just because of advancements in ai over the past few years the real catalyst for the industry to start gaining momentum actually happened back in 2012 winterroth said when kiva systems a small startup based out of massachusetts got acquired by amazon i like to say kiva systems acquisition was the acquisition that launched 1 000 robotic startups winterroth said between 2011 and 2015 2016 that really was the case you just saw a number of different new companies get started some like 6 river systems or clearpath robotics were successful but most were not but that talent learns and that learning compounds and it s brought into the next set of ventures this first wave helped attract engineers to the sector and helped companies figure out product market fit he said kira noodleman a partner at bee partners echoed this noodleman told techcrunch the last decade of trial and error helped startups figure out what the market is actually looking for when it comes to robotics and automation some companies like rapid robotics which noodleman backed shut down trying to figure out what the market wanted those failures have helped the next batch of startup founders who now have a much better idea of what potential customers want from this sector noodleman had a similar experience with her own investing thesis she said which changed as the market matured lights out manufacturing assumes there are zero humans in the loop that is just not happening we proved that already back in the 2010s noodleman said let me take a simple task machine tending all it is is someone s hand putting something in and out of a machine the point here is you can imagine how many low hanging fruit repetitive tasks there are like machine tending fady saad a general partner at early stage robotics focused cybernetix ventures also launched his firm prior to the ai boom after he noticed he was spending a lot of time connecting early stage robotics companies to sources of funding during his time as a co founder at massrobotics falling hardware costs have also driven investor interest in the sector saad said noting that it s cheaper to build robots today than five years ago this allows companies to have a more viable path to scale and makes them more attractive to potential venture backers the cost of building robotics has been going dramatically down saad said advances in sensor technology compute and batteries all of that it was the perfect timing to start full stack robotics solutions advancements in ai aren t hurting the industry either while ai is being touted by many as the main reason why robotics are starting to see an increase in interest alongside an elon musk driven fascination with humanoid robots it isn t the only factor saad added that while ai and large language models can be helpful for training robots these llms are primarily trained on online information whereas robots interact with the real world there are companies building models based on that real life data nvidia just released a new set of world models for robot training in august but saad predicted it will take a bit longer to capture and train robots especially those that will exist alongside people on world data momentum in the industry may be starting to swell but that doesn t mean every startup has figured out the best approach yet nor are some categories within robotics as mature as others some of the first few markets to adopt robotics and automation including manufacturing warehousing and construction continue to be attractive for robotics startup backers for winterroth saad and noodleman healthcare and surgical related robots remain a compelling area to invest in too noodleman adds eldercare to that category as well in home assistance is interesting coming from me having looked at industrial robotics for 10 years noodleman said manufacturing and mining burning labor shortages aging populations no humans are available at any price even imperfect robotics are better than nothing saad added that vertically focused robotics companies tend to have access to more real world and physical data too than horizontal players one area that these vcs are not as excited about are humanoids or consumer and especially not consumer focused humanoids saad isn t convinced that people will want to have a robot in their house anytime soon he added that even non humanoid consumer focused robotics companies have struggled to get consumers excited the only successful consumer robot company irobot failed to come up with a second act saad said pool cleaning robot lawn mower mopping and floor cleaning robot none of these worked out for whatever reason while the industry is still years away from commercial success of more intricate robotic models like humanoids vcs are pouring more capital into the sector despite the fact that this interest is driving up the costs of deals the surge in interest is a net positive for the industry winterroth and saad said as the potential customer base for robotics startups continues to grow there are enough examples of successful commercial organizations successful robotics companies that have become a valuable commercial organization winterroth said ten 15 years ago it was questionable whether or not there was going to be a large and thriving marketplace for these types of solutions now there s a lot of customer

startups love hiring big business leaders into advisory and c suite roles these hires solve a common issue as startups grow and look to compete with incumbents they need some corporate talent to see them over the line but big established businesses have a different common issue they re too big too established and being outcompeted by the very companies that are hiring their talent right now it s the hare and the tortoise but slow and steady isn t winning the race this time established businesses need to take a page out of the startup playbook and hire for the c suite from their competitors the startups larger more established businesses are often embarrassingly slow to change they re overly bureaucratic addicted to legacy systems and unable to compete in the race for new critical opportunities for example bureaucratic silos at ibm led to budget fights and leaders focusing on protecting mainframe revenue instead of aggressively pivoting to cloud computing competition raced ahead large businesses are far too slow to innovate stuck in an if it ain t broke don t fix it mentality they aren t chasing new products markets and technologies fast enough to stay competitive this was the case for kodak which clung to the once lucrative film business for far too long failing to embrace the digital camera space which cannibalised film sales the company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2012 now the proliferation of ai in the corporate world and its ability to facilitate breakneck innovation with small teams must be a wake up call for big business so what s the solution big businesses need to hire boldly they must put their faith in tech entrepreneurs and bring them into the c suite startup leaders can conquer the groupthink that currently infects the boardrooms of most established businesses where executives are often hired from the same industry and from other large incumbent businesses these leaders can act like disruptors bringing in new ideas and a culture of experimentation they re also not afraid to fail because they recognise this is a key step towards innovation startup leaders are also far more tuned in to shifting consumer trends they reflexively look pan sector pan market to identify trends and opportunities and will act decisively to seize them big businesses hold the customer data and assume it gives them the clearest view of emerging trends this is wrong their data is biased towards the status quo and where trends can be identified they re micro trends taking place within the strict confines of the existing business and its products or services for this instinct is far more important and startup leaders tend to have the strongest market instincts startup leaders are also adept at breaking down departmental silos to build agile cross functional teams for example a startup leader is used to working in a tight team directly with engineers marketers and customer support to build and scale new products at speed at large businesses the same process is compartmentalised full of barriers and indirect some will question whether startup leaders can handle the big corporate machine but the truth is that s where many of the best ones started most corporate leaders have worked only in corporates startup leaders have almost always done both others might wonder if entrepreneurs will want to give up their startup freedom it s a great point and the answer is to give them freedom let them have an outsized impact give them the budget they need they ll move on quickly and leave an innovation playbook that s fine i m an entrepreneur and investor i build and back startups i love seeing them disrupt industries but there s no reason industries can t be disrupted by the incumbents too the competitiveness would benefit everyone but to get there we need to see big businesses leaning on the expertise of their startup competitors dr david von rosen is the principal of the vonrosen family office through which he invests internationally in high risk pan sector startu show all dr david von rosen is the principal of the vonrosen family office through which he invests internationally in high risk pan sector startups with a particular focus on technology renewable energy and finance he s also launched a series of his own ventures including lottery giant lottoland and a super prime property developer 25 degrees get the most important tech news in your inbox each week
startup wisdom is a new tnw series offering practical lessons from experts who ve helped build great companies this week vivian acquah a certified inclusion strategist workshop facilitator and founder of amplify dei shares her tips on ending meeting hangovers so you re a leader your leadership involves managing a team while having both a defined direction and multiple essential goals that need completion your goal is to plan effectively and empower your team to achieve high performance the truth is that team leadership extends beyond goal achievement leaders must handle the complex interpersonal situations that emerge when working with people the speed and continuous change of your present work environment make this task extremely challenging how do you share ownership without losing control what are some practical ways to foster accountability while avoiding micromanagement how do you support your team during periods of organisational change these are the questions that keep leaders up at night but there s one challenge one sneaky often overlooked productivity killer that might be flying under your radar meeting hangovers yes meeting hangovers let s unpack this we ve all been there you leave a meeting and instead of feeling energised or clear headed you feel off maybe the meeting dragged on too long perhaps it was poorly run or maybe it left unresolved tensions hanging in the air whatever the reason you walk away feeling drained your focus is lost your motivation gone and instead of diving back into your work you find yourself replaying parts of the meeting in your head over and over that s a meeting hangover according to research from the university of north carolina and work management platform asana meeting hangovers are more common and more damaging than you might think in a survey of 5 000 knowledge workers in the us and uk over 90 admitted to experiencing meeting hangovers at least occasionally more than half said these hangovers negatively impacted their productivity and 47 reported feeling less engaged with their work afterwards but it doesn t stop there the survey revealed that meeting hangovers affected how coworkers interacted with each other producing negative effects on their relationships people felt disconnected disengaged and frankly like they just wanted to be left alone for a team attempting to meet its objectives this is a problem a big one despite the name meeting hangovers don t just fade away as your team moves on to their next task the negative effects of such meetings extend beyond the meeting duration to impact both individual job performance and team dynamics these effects tend to fall into three categories 1 loss of momentum a meeting with no clear direction interrupts productivity when decisions are delayed or misinterpreted team members end up spending more time clarifying than executing 2 decreased engagement meetings that occur too often and lack proper facilitation can activate disengagement among team members when team members feel that their time isn t valued and their voices are unheard frustration builds which in turn reduces workplace morale 3 ripple effect on creativity and collaboration prolonged meeting related stress suppresses cognitive functions like creativity which makes teams less innovative and solution focused meetings that operate improperly erode psychological safety which serves as an essential requirement for team collaboration to succeed by recognising the depth of this challenge startup founders and leaders can take intentional steps to combat its effects and prioritise productive energising and inclusive meeting practices an overlooked yet highly effective way to address meeting hangovers is through inclusive leadership creating a space where all voices are valued and accountability is shared provides the psychological safety needed for high impact collaboration the following three methods help teams mitigate meeting hangovers and enhance their performance levels unstructured meetings create confusion and waste time for participants setting clear expectations from the start helps participants maintain focus and enables efficient use of their meeting time actionable steps impact agendas that are properly set help eliminate confusion while keeping discussions on track to achieve results allowing everyone to direct their energy toward moving forward the cognitive toll of meetings can linger especially following intense discussions when team members take brief mental breaks after meetings they develop better focus and clearer thinking actionable steps impact the practice of unwind to rewind enhances both stress reduction and team member success at their upcoming work tasks it s a simple yet powerful way to enable sustained productivity across your team activating inclusive leadership ensures that meetings are energising spaces where everyone feels empowered to contribute shared accountability drives follow through and builds trust among team members actionable steps impact an inclusive meeting environment promotes clear communication alongside creative problem solving and team unity this

in a recent interview with tnw jelle prins the mind behind uber s first app shared his vision of a world transformed by autonomous vehicles imagine getting into a car here in amsterdam in the evening he mused and waking up the next morning in a mountain village in france for a day of snowboarding in his mind self driving is the next step in the evolution of mobility and the question is not if but when it will land in europe he shared his vision for this future and his plans to design proteins using ai with tnw founder boris veldhuijzen van zaten in the latest episode of kia s next big drive watch the full interview by clicking below the kia ev9 featured in the interview is a level 2 autonomous vehicle based on a 0 5 scale of driving automation it uses adaptive cruise control acc an advanced technology that enables the car to drive more autonomously by matching the speed of the car in front but a human driver is still needed this is all part of automakers gradual release of new adaptive technologies that are bringing us closer and closer to level 5 autonomous vehicles which don t require a driver at all while avs are being introduced at a gradual pace commercially we can expect avs to be adopted in public transport at a much more rapid pace as part of horizon 2020 the european commission is currently funding research projects into driverless public transport across the eu but the us china and more recently the uk are already far ahead and gaining speed tnw city coworking space where your best work happens a workspace designed for growth collaboration and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech in the us companies like waymo alphabet s av subsidiary have already deployed commercial robotaxi services across phoenix san francisco los angeles and austin next year they plan to expand into atlanta miami and washington dc in 2026 in china baidu has tested its apollo go autonomous ride hailing service in over 15 cities and is aiming for 100 cities by 2030 even the uk often slower to adopt emerging mobility tech passed a landmark automated vehicles av act in 2024 creating a unified legal framework pilot av programmes are slated for 2026 with wayve and uber already planning trials in contrast the eu remains fragmented with inconsistent infrastructure patchy 5g coverage and no shared regulatory roadmap the bloc risks falling behind unless it can harmonise standards and accelerate investment imagine the canals of amsterdam stripped of parking spots and lined instead with trees community gardens and outdoor cafes what if barcelona s superblocks urban planning aimed at bringing traffic restricted pedestrian friendly zones to city dwellers could be brought to cities like paris and berlin avs could supercharge these trends making cities more livable and accessible for everyone living further outside the city could be less of a problem if your commute becomes part of your morning ritual passengers could enjoy a cup of coffee read or fire up their laptop without having to concentrate on the road avs could communicate and coordinate their movements with smart city infrastructure allowing for real time traffic management this could lead to optimised routing reduced congestion and smoother traffic flow for example some cities are experimenting with dynamic traffic lights that adapt in real time to traffic conditions using sensors cameras and algorithms is europe ready for an av future not all the potential consequences of avs are positive as with the rise of uber a wave of automation could disrupt millions of jobs in the transportation sector from truck drivers to delivery workers and taxi operators according to calculations by kpmg avs could lower the cost of public transportation by up to 50 considering 600 000 people work in the transport and logistics sector in the netherlands the total loss of income could amount to 14bn a year if these jobs are lost reskilling programs need to be introduced for these workers avs also raise troubling ethical questions for example how should a car choose between two harmful outcomes in an unavoidable crash scenario to prepare for this future scholars are debating the best way to align such intelligent systems with human moral judgment there s also the issue of cybersecurity as vehicles become more connected they also become vulnerable to hacking posing risks not only to passengers but to entire transportation systems last year researchers developed a hack dubbed madradar able to bypass anti spoofing protections and make avs hallucinate phantom cars on the road the future of autonomy hinges on more than software and sensors it needs roads to match the tech one glaring challenge is the lack of consistent signage and road standards across europe a 2023 literature review highlights how variations in signage design language and placement across eu countries present significant hurdles for avs which rely on image recognition and machine learning to interpret their surroundings then there s the question of digital infrastructure reliable 5g networks vehicle to everything v2x communication and up to date digital maps are essential for real time decision making and safety cities that lack these assets risk being left behind finally there s the matter of legislation as of mid 2025 each eu member state has wildly varying rules on av testing and deployment liability also remains a murky issue if a self driving car crashes who s at fault the manufacturer the software developer or the passenger these inconsistencies could slow down adoption in europe even as tech giants in the us and china race ahead until governments create unified frameworks that ensure safety without stifling innovation mass deployment will remain on the distant horizon whether or not avs are actually safer than human drivers is still unclear a study by swiss re that came out this year claimed waymo s autonomous vehicles have up to 92 fewer liability claims than human driven cars however other studies have highlighted that avs still face challenges in complex scenarios like dawn dusk driving and turning at intersections where they have higher accident rates compared to human drivers interestingly a study into the psychological biases drivers have about avs revealed that the researchers argued that focusing on safety as the key benefit of avs may be the wrong approach on kia s next big drive prins predicted that self driving vehicles will be on european roads soon but the reality is more nuanced technologically avs are getting close societally and politically we re still playing catch up the question is no longer if autonomous vehicles will arrive but how we ll adapt when they do will we embrace the potential for greener safer and more accessible cities or will we replicate the mistakes of the past replacing one set of problems with another one thing is certain the self driving future isn t just about cars it

the entanglement of tech and politics has become impossible to ignore especially in the united states where the lines between silicon valley and washington are rapidly dissolving at president trump s inauguration the ceos of amazon meta and alphabet took prominent seats even ahead of cabinet nominees an unmistakable sign of how closely us tech giants are now intertwined with national policy agendas just days earlier outgoing president biden had warned of a rising tech industrial complex this isn t just symbolism it reflects a broader shift us tech firms are aligning themselves with a domestic industrial strategy that treats cloud ai and digital infrastructure as tools of geopolitical power for europe the implications are becoming harder to ignore france s ai and digital minister has since warned of digital predators undermining european autonomy in germany government agencies have started phasing out microsoft teams in favour of domestic collaboration tools and in denmark a nationwide migration to open source linux systems is underway these are not isolated incidents they signal the early stages of a digital sovereignty movement one driven as much by pragmatism as by politics for europe reclaiming control over digital infrastructure is no longer a fringe idea it s a strategic imperative tnw city coworking space where your best work happens a workspace designed for growth collaboration and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech europe s dependency on foreign hyperscalers is deep and longstanding the majority of government services healthcare systems and private sector infrastructure run on platforms controlled by microsoft amazon web services aws and google this reliance has become so entrenched that it has long gone unnoticed until now consider the us cloud act which gives american authorities the right to access data stored on us owned servers even if that data resides in europe for eu citizens and enterprises this creates a fundamental contradiction their data is simultaneously subject to local privacy laws like the gdpr and to foreign surveillance laws they cannot influence vendor lock in compounds the problem many organisations find themselves tied to proprietary ecosystems with limited portability unable to move or replicate workloads across providers without significant cost or risk worse still operational decisions such as product changes pricing or data handling practices are increasingly made without european input cloud infrastructure has become critical infrastructure the question is no longer whether it matters who controls it but what happens when those controls sit thousands of miles away in different jurisdictions with different interests european governments are beginning to act france has launched substantial investments in domestic cloud initiatives supporting providers like ovhcloud and investing in sovereign platforms that have secnumcloud certification germany meanwhile has taken steps to reduce its reliance on non european providers across federal agencies in the case of denmark the shift to linux isn t just about cost saving it s about control transparency and security hardly surprising considering trump s interest in greenland these moves are not reactive or symbolic they are part of a broader shift toward digital self determination one that recognises sovereignty as a foundation for resilience for too long europe s digital future has been outsourced now there is a growing realisation that true independence requires owning the stack from infrastructure and identity to data and application logic this movement is not about anti american sentiment nor is it an argument for economic protectionism european digital sovereignty is not a rejection of global collaboration it s a recalibration of risk governments and enterprises alike are waking up to the reality that resilience cannot be achieved through over reliance on a narrow set of providers when infrastructure is dominated by a handful of foreign vendors the system becomes brittle not strong europe should move towards a more robust approach defined by for identity and access management in particular open protocols like oauth and openid connect enable multi cloud orchestration this means that if an organisation needs to switch providers or host in a new region their identity layer can remain consistent and secure a crucial capability in an era of geopolitical turbulence and accelerating cyber threats the path to digital sovereignty does not require a revolution but it does demand focus and follow through a practical approach begins with auditing existing digital dependencies not just at the infrastructure level but across the full digital stack from there organisations should identify where resilience and portability are weakest and where they are most exposed to external decisions beyond their control this assessment should inform a phased diversification strategy that might mean gradually shifting workloads to sovereign clouds adopting open source alternatives to proprietary software or decoupling key components such as authentication or api management from single vendor ecosystems governments have a role to play not only in policy and procurement but in investing in skills and local innovation ecosystems sovereignty is not a checklist item it is a capability that requires sustained support to build and maintain in a world where digital systems underpin every aspect of life from education and healthcare to finance and national defence infrastructure control is no longer a technical issue it is a matter of strategic independence europe has a choice to make continue relying on foreign platforms for its most sensitive digital functions or invest in a future it can truly own sovereignty is not about isolation it s about agency the power to shape a digital future that reflects european values laws and long term interests gustaf joined curity as

driving electric can be a pleasure but charging often feels like a pain public facilities can be hard to find prices swing wildly and hidden fees add up incompatible systems and long waits only deepen the frustration leaving drivers anxious about where to charge and what it will cost a dutch startup called tap electric has ambitious plans to solve these problems founded in 2020 the company has built a platform to make charging transparent accessible and affordable for drivers the platform provides clearer choices cheaper options and tools to manage their charging sessions for ev station owners installers and operators it offers free management software that simplifies operations the strategy proved a big hit at tnw conference tap electric won the event s pitch battle impressing the judging panel of investors industry leaders and media insiders with a compelling vision for the future of ev charging after scooping the grand prize nico spoelstra the startup s co founder and ceo shared his mission for the business if we want to speed up adoption we have to make driving renting or owning an ev extremely affordable compared to other options he said the of eu tech the latest rumblings from the eu tech scene a story from our wise ol founder boris and some questionable ai art it s free every week in your inbox sign up now tap supports drivers in three key ways first it helps them find the cheapest charging stations through the tap app users can locate chargers compare pricing and understand their upfront costs the app shows all public chargers with pricing directly on the map subscribers can also see the cheapest prices and choose to charge via the app or ev charge card across the startup s public charger network the system aims to cut through the complexity of finding the best deal with different pricing models varying network structures and the growing popularity of dynamic pricing the cost of charging a vehicle is increasingly unclear in response we use the driver s charging behaviour to predict the price of their next charge on any charger so that they can still compare the cost of different chargers spoelstra said spoelstra has experienced the benefits personally when i drove to france last year i didn t plan my route i picked the next fast charger before leaving the previous one and then just drove to it the second strand of tap s plan is optimising charging using ai algorithms the startup predicts the best times and places to plug in giving drivers more for their money with costs calculated in real time during a session within the app a suite of tools turns scattered data into actionable guidance price intel deciphers a single charger s tariff including idle fees and time based pricing map intel takes a broader view analysing the entire dutch public network to spot the cheapest operators and the most expensive tap insights lets drivers review the networks they ve used in the past see the impact on their charging costs and then receive recommendations for cheaper alternatives nearby we work with dutch public charging operators to take this one step further and do this in the public domain on the street spoelstra said helping people without their own driveway monetise their car s flexibility to get a cheaper charge is vital for ev adoption a third focus is simplifying the software behind charging while many platforms grew bloated and confusing tap automated processes from the start the streamlined approach keeps operations lean we give that advantage back to our customers by making our software free to use for managing chargers and providing the cheapest charge card in the netherlands spoelstra said spoelstra is upbeat about the progress of ev charging but still sees further challenges ahead chief among them are grid constraints and high energy prices to ease the strain tap works with networks and grid operators to lower peak loads that enables more chargers to run on the same cables reducing the need for costly infrastructure upgrades the company also offers bi directional charging which allows energy to flow both to the grid and back into it as a result car batteries become valuable grid assets the more we help drivers monetise the flexibility of a battery the more we can help lower energy costs spoelstra said spoelstra takes great encouragement from the rapid rollout of hyper fast charging stations from companies such as fastned and tesla he positions tap as a powerful addition to the landscape guiding drivers to the nearest fast charger for their needs he s now setting his sights on another target deeper integration with energy infrastructure insights into price and power are vital but the real difference is made with our charge control algorithms that establish symbiosis between cars the grid and energy markets you ll see us make some big moves there in the coming months if those moves pay off even charging electric could go from a pain to a pleasure thomas is the managing

local contractors helping to boost the local economy recently a finnish town of 5 000 people introduced a sand battery that uses dirt to store excess renewable energy as heat on a sunny or windy day the battery heats up storing energy for weeks or even months polar night the startup behind the battery estimates the battery will be able to heat the whole town for a week in winter or an entire month in summer on just one charge this pilot project could kick start a new trend for communities looking to heat their homes and businesses sustainably however the iberia wide blackout on april 28th fueled skepticism with some blaming spain and portugal s net zero ambitions just before the blackout on april 16th spain had reached a milestone by running 100 on wind solar and hydro power for the first time our sustainability tech reporter si n geschwindt based in portugal was quick to report on the story at the time interviewing several climate tech experts who attributed the iberian blackout points to grid growing pains not green energy failure while wind and solar generate clean cheap electricity they don t produce power in a steady stream they rise and fall with the weather however grids in europe were largely built for more predictable sources of energy like coal gas or nuclear plants says geschwindt without that stabilising force or the addition of alternatives like battery storage systems the grid becomes more vulnerable to surges in electricity demand or supply experts including carbon equity portfolio company octopus energy say updating the grid to enable more flexibility is an essential step for the transition south australia experienced a similar blackout in 2016 afterwards it strengthened its grid by introducing by 2023 south australia achieved 64 renewable electricity with zero major outages while helping to significantly lower co2 emissions the rise of evs could also put pressure on the demand for green energy but carmakers are preparing for a future in which your car will become more than a way of getting from a to b it could also play an integral role in the energy ecosystem of the future the interview between van den ende and tnw founder boris veldhuijzen van zanten took place in kia s all electric ev9 the first model equipped with vehicle to grid technology and bidirectional charging allowing it to store energy gained from renewable sources and feed it back into the power grid in fact a fully charged ev9 with a 99 8kwh battery could power a household for about one week in a recent study researchers explored the benefits of using an ev to optimise solar energy sharing between neighbours they found that this arrangement could cut electricity costs for both households by about 1 2 cents per kilowatt hour for the solar owning home and 3 6 cents for the neighbor a fraunhofer study for t e investigated the potential economic benefits of vehicles to grid technology for the wider eu with some promising findings potential savings in grid expansion costs could reach 9 8 billion by 2040 but the researchers warn that this technology should not be seen as a substitute for necessary grid reinforcement and expansion however infrastructure requirements standardization of the technology and regulatory frameworks governing safety and fair pricing in energy trading between ev owners and utility companies are a few roadblocks that need to be worked out before we can realise the full potential of evs for now it seems the use of evs as batteries on wheels will be very much a community led experiment the learnings of which can be used to later scale up this potential for example studies into offsetting lost energy during working hours and developing heterogeneous energy sharing across multiple communities are all steps in a more energy efficient direction scaling up energy community led initiatives and experiments could be key to helping the eu move past the energy transition tipping point

founders takes is a new series featuring expert insights from tech leaders transforming industries with artificial intelligence in this edition steven kleinveld founder of applied ai lab skylark argues that vibe coding won t replace developers it ll upgrade them there s been a lot of talk lately that ai is going to replace developers with the rise of tools that let you prompt your way into building apps people are starting to wonder are developers even still needed the short answer yes more than ever the hype around no code and vibe coding makes it seem like anyone can build a solid mvp overnight and sure tools like lovable bolt and canva code are great for testing ideas quickly but once things get more complex these tools hit a ceiling you still need someone who knows how things actually work backend logic data flows design systems ux decisions the stuff that makes a product good not just functional that s where developers come in and not just any developers but those who know how to work with ai not fear it tnw city coworking space where your best work happens a workspace designed for growth collaboration and endless networking opportunities in the heart of tech this isn t the end of developers it s a shift in how they work it s well documented that llms such as anthropic s claude google s gemini and openai s chatgpt have been drastically improving as a result of this the quality of ai tooling has skyrocketed allowing developers to work with superhuman efficiency thus becoming more valuable this moment in tech isn t about replacing developers it s about how they evolve just to be clear ai is amazing at taking care of the repetitive stuff generating code snippets filling in boilerplate even giving you a head start on a frontend but that doesn t mean it can build a reliable secure and scalable product from scratch as the ceo of skylark an applied ai lab i m well aware of how quickly the field is evolving but it will still be years before ai models master all three elements reliability security and scalability without a human in the loop the real winners in this ai wave developers who know how to work with it if you re a backend developer ai can help you with front end tasks you re less confident in if you re full stack you can use it to speed up your workflow and focus on the tricky parts you enjoy most it s like having a really fast assistant but you still need to be the one steering the ship the key is knowing what you re good at what you re not and where ai can fill in the gaps that s what makes a developer ai savvy and in my view that s becoming one of the most valuable skills out there we ve all seen the trend of prompting an ai to just build this and hoping it works it s fast it s playful and sometimes it s surprisingly good but it can also lead to what i call ai drift when your product slowly shifts away from your original idea because the ai starts adding unnecessary features or misinterpreting what you want this is where experienced developers make the difference they know when something s off they know when to stop the ai and fix things they know how to spot bugs or security issues the ai missed non technical folks often miss these signs and that s where things can break fast so no ai isn t replacing developers it s giving the best ones extra gear of course not every founder will be technical but even non tech founders will need to understand how ai works and more importantly what its limits are knowing how to prompt an ai is one thing knowing when the output is wrong is a whole other skill developers who learn how to work with ai will only become more valuable they ll build faster smarter and with fewer people but they ll still be the ones driving the process so if you re a developer wondering if ai is coming for your job i d say don t worry just get familiar with the tools stay sharp on your skills and figure out how ai can make you better this isn t the end of the road it s a new chapter and developers are still very much the main characters steven is the founder of skylark an applied ai lab on a mission to build tools that make devs unstoppable internally skylark combines wor show all steven is the founder of skylark an applied ai lab on a mission to build tools that make devs unstoppable internally skylark combines world class engineering with a top of the line ai native skillset to build the next generation of tools for those building what s next get the most important tech news in your inbox each week
a few days ago i took all my research and turned it into a blog about designing and launching a serverless federated database for ai agents i ll admit that first blog post was me squeezing all my research and ideas together under pressure since then i ve received a lot of feedback read even more and refined the vision i believe it s now complete the goal has been to design build and ship an ai first database that redefines retrieval for ai meridiandb goes beyond semantic meaning adding temporal contextual and behavioral dimensions and aims to solve catastrophic forgetting striking a better balance between stability and plasticity first iteration fixing ai amnesia meridiandb s answer to costly training and memory loss after three more iterations the vision is now solid i know what i can ship within the next three weeks and i ve made major architectural changes to the database let s ground the work and ship by oct 7 the most common solution today is rag retrieval augmented generation a technique that enhances llms by fetching external up to date domain specific data before generating a response meridiandb takes this further expanding the dimensions of meaning for agents semantic features same as rag the agent retrieves relevant contextual data via semantic search temporal features goes beyond simple time range queries contextual features includes user environment task descriptions goals whatever context the developer thinks the agent needs to perform optimally rag pipelines are powerful but bring several challenges meridiandb addresses these issues out of the box while pushing retrieval innovation forward 1 2 human clients one driven by app logic one for db operators 3 worker api gateway handles requests from both clients and sdk integrations 4 eventual consistency model write operations are queued simplifying retries and error handling while following cloudflare s consistency model 5 8 queues publish write events consumed by workers for vectorization and d1 9 retrieval engine performs multi dimensional queries for the ai agent 10 14 behavioral logging tracks agent performance on tasks creating a feedback loop for improvement queue based architecture ensures eventual consistency without developer orchestration of multiple datastores this reduces overhead and eliminates ghost embeddings data is stored redundantly vector d1 to maintain its multidimensional context a tradeoff made deliberately for reliability no need to glue together multiple systems meridiandb comes with a built in operator interface for observability critical for debugging agent behavior and improving performance over time behavioral logging allows for continuous improvement even continuous learning in the future you can measure whether retrieved context led to task success or failure through continuously updated decision trees reads may lag slightly behind writes read after write guarantees may need replicas or caching strategies developers must provide contextual features task description environment etc future iterations could offload this to an agent that auto generates context temporal decay means data needs periodic cleanup this can be handled with background jobs meridiandb introduces new mental models temporal semantic behavioral contextual developers familiar with basic rag pipelines may need time to adapt the sdk is designed to hide most of this complexity exposing only three core methods store retrieve log cloudflare native architecture delivers great performance but ties you to that ecosystem

in this blog post i want to talk about the process of optimizing locale handling in a next js application our initial implementation relied on a cookie based approach for internationalization which forced dynamic rendering and reduced both performance and seo effectiveness migrating to a locale based routing strategy where the locale is embedded directly in the url path e g en about ja about enabled next js to pre render locale specific routes at build time this restored the benefits of static site generation ssg resulting in faster load times and improved seo embedding the locale directly into the url path solves these challenges each locale specific path becomes a static route that can be pre rendered at build time for instance en about and ja about are treated as distinct static pages each with its respective translations this approach simplifies navigation logic and enhances seo urls are shareable and bookmarkable with the correct language context and search engines can index each locale individually improving discoverability we can achieve this cleanly by separating our next intl configuration into dedicated files first we create a central configuration file to define our locales and their names this promotes code reusability and makes it easy to add or remove languages in the future next we define our routing strategy by setting localeprefix never we explicitly tell next intl that we are handling the locale prefixes ourselves through the next js locale dynamic segment this prevents next intl from adding an extra prefix to our urls note the localeprefix option controls whether the locale appears in the url path choosing the right option depends on whether url based seo and shareable links for each locale are important we then use our defined routing configuration to create custom navigation helpers this ensures that every time we use link userouter or other navigation functions they automatically respect our locale based routing setup the request ts file handles the server side logic for fetching locale specific data we use getrequestconfig to determine the correct locale from the request and load the corresponding message files the haslocale helper function is crucial here to ensure a valid locale is being requested falling back to the defaultlocale if not our root layout handles the foundational setup for every page we use setrequestlocale locale to tell next intl to use the locale from the url this allows next js to leverage static rendering because the locale is known at the time of the request the haslocale check also helps us catch invalid locales and serve a notfound page this component provides a user friendly way to change the language it uses the custom userouter and usepathname from our navigation ts file when the user selects a new locale the router push call automatically updates the url path to reflect the new language e g from en about to ja about a catch all route ensures consistent handling of invalid urls or unsupported locales by moving from a cookie based locale system to url based routing static site generation is fully restored while keeping internationalization seamless and seo friendly the modular structure simplifies adding new locales ensures consistent routing and improves overall application performance

void interactive s 2023 gritty tactical shooter ready or not is copaganda not necessarily in a bad way but like any game or media really that centers on the heroics of law enforcement it inevitably shapes and reinforces how we perceive the police copaganda is the shorthand critics use for media that paints policing in an uncritically positive light smoothing over its flaws and presenting officers as the thin blue line between order and chaos it runs the gamut from glossy network dramas like blue bloods or law order where the cops are always right and the system mostly works to schoolhouse outreach programs like d a r e which critics say were less about teaching kids not to do drugs and more about putting cops in classrooms and encouraging kids to report on their own families for the past month i ve been playing the newly released console version of ready or not on playstation 5 a port surrounded by controversy and charges of censorship void interactive the studio behind the game said in a steam post that changes were made to the game to help it get published on consoles not that ready or not is a stranger to backlash back in 2021 during its early access phase the game s developers parted ways with publisher team17 after confirming to fans that yes a school shooting mission would be included and it eventually was at its most cynical reading ready or not plays to the reactionary fever dreams of right wing paranoia a dystopian urban hellscape los sue os a fictional version of los angeles overrun by gangs cartels and pedophiles with only heavily armed tactical units assigned to bring order to chaos it s a narrative that echoes the real life messaging often pushed by law enforcement especially when crime intersects with race and poverty void interactive and the most vocal corners of its fanbase position ready or not as an unflinching hyper realistic police simulator its lore and tactical realism approach have also made the game especially popular within the milsim military simulation community a niche gaming community filled with former and active service members alongside die hard military enthusiasts the game they claim is meant to immerse players in the grim high stakes world swat teams face daily no matter how ugly that world gets and to be fair the game plays all the greatest hits of modern american trauma a school shooting a pulse nightclub inspired massacre a hospital siege apartment block shootouts and even multiple standoffs with libertarian and anarchist compounds building missions directly modeled on some of the darkest chapters in recent u s history requires a certain appetite for edginess and a noticeable lack of tact don t worry call of duty does it too and yet here s the frustrating truth for players like me who aren t aligned with its vision ready or not is really fucking fun to play one of the biggest selling points of ready or not and a huge part of why i love it is that it s functionally a survival horror game disguised as a tactical shooter void interactive basically said what if we took the vibe of swat 4 s fairfax residence mission and built an entire game around it the tension of breaching a door the uncertainty of what s waiting around the next corner the rush of pulling off a flawless takedown the oppressive atmosphere of dread it all clicks so perfectly that it s easy for a moment to forget what exactly the game is asking you to buy into that s no accident because for all its reputation as an ultra realistic shooter ready or not absolutely leans into violence and it doesn t do much to discourage it in practice the game rewards you for clearing rooms and dropping suspects with lethal precision every encounter demands it fail to follow the rules of engagement and you ll be slapped with failing grades at the end of a mission however while non lethal play is a part of the game it s treated more like a challenge mode for players chasing high s rankings rather than a meaningful core mechanic your non lethal arsenal in ready or not is limited a taser a beanbag rifle pepper spray gas grenades and flashbangs you can try to incapacitate suspects with low caliber rounds instead of killing them outright but that demands split second decision making in high pressure scenarios where npcs can whip out a gun and shoot you dead without warning in this way the gameplay echoes police narratives on dealing with crime the developers after all did speak with multiple law enforcement officers to accurately reflect their experience an experience that if they are to be taken at their word involves a world where every door conceals an armed suspect every call could spiral into a shootout and hesitation can mean death it s a perspective that reinforces the idea that constant overwhelming force is the most rational response it s deeply problematic and it also makes for incredible level design you almost have to go on to every traffic stop assuming there is a firearm in that car said an ohio police sergeant to spectrum news back in may yet according to a mapping police violence report police killed 108 unarmed civilians in 2024 and 77 so far in 2025 out of the 1 260 total deaths at the hands of police mpv reported last year the organization said 619 occurred during responses to suspected non violent crimes or in situations where no crime had been reported at all if ready or not were truly chasing police realism you d be filling out endless reports running traffic stops and standing around at concerts while you collect overtime early in development the developers promised that no subject was too controversial no tragedy too sensitive to depict ready or not would dive into the darkest corners of society without restraint and players loved that it s why the game has spawned a whole ecosystem of youtube video essays with titles like the most distrubing shooter i ve ever played and it s also why the game was review bombed when it finally hit consoles depending on who you ask the changes are trivial at best toned down gore previously naked female npcs covered up and a convulsing child swapped out for a sleeping one but to the hardcore fanbase it was the developers caving to corporate pressure selling out the very no compromises ethos that made ready or not stand out in the first place the data doesn t exactly back up the fan outrage theory when ready or not dropped on consoles on july 15 it sold over 2 million copies in just two weeks this despite getting review bombed on steam over the censorship changes the numbers make it clear though people are playing and they re having a good time in fact they re having such a good time that some players have been sharing their own gameplay clips many of which feature uh gleeful examples of brutal extrajudicial police violence so yeah for a long time as a kid and then as a teenager i never really understood why people hated fps games to me it was just a game studies have shown again and again that they don t cause real world violence no matter how much the jack thompsons of the world tried to build careers pretending otherwise my mom hated them and as my dad got older he grew more ambivalent too even though some of my best memories are sitting next to him watching as he gunned down enemies from an ac 130 in call of duty 4 they were fun then and i still believe they re fun now but fun doesn t mean harmless a study in the national library of medicine concluded that exposure to violent video games increases the risk of desensitization to violence which in turn may increase aggression and decrease prosocial behavior games don t turn kids into killers that we know for sure but they do shape how we think about violence and authority spending hours in digital meth houses and rundown apartment complexes can normalize certain ideas that violence is the fastest solution about who good guys and bad guys look like and that shooting your way out is the natural end to conflict it s not cause and effect in the cartoonish way moral panickers try and claim but it does leave an imprint this isn t me saying that everyone who plays ready or not or other tactical shooters like it is waving bluelivesmatter flags call me woke if you want but a lot of the game really does boil down to busting into low income areas and arresting poor poc and for all of ready or not s deep gun and gear customization it feels damning that i can t change my character s skin color in single player though i can in multiplayer yet here i am gunning down a black guy in a durag i don t know maybe that does add to the ultra gritty realism the game prides itself on this article reflects the opinions of the writer topics video games chance townsend is the general

as the company that either invented or popularized the dive watch the gmt watch the first water resistant watch the first automatic watches and much more besides you could hardly downplay rolex s influence on watchmaking history but while its iconic sports watches like the submariner daytona and gmt master are endlessly imitated rolex is not seen as a trendsetter preferring to ignore passing horological fashions it does its own thing iterating carefully and minimally on its age old templates five years ago however rolex introduced a collection so avant garde that is still influencing creative decisions across the entire watch industry and it did so in one of its least heralded models the oyster perpetual the idea was so simple that we ve barely noticed it become the industry norm instead of slowly rolling out new dial colours one at a time over a period of years which was standard watch world behavior until that point rolex launched a whole set of colored dials in a complementary palette all at once the 2020 multi color oyster perpetual collection that started the wave of watch world bright dials they were bright bold and almost childlike in their purity coral red green turquoise pink and yellow rolex watchers immediately hailed them as a tribute to the so called stella dial day date watches of the late 1970s and 1980s equally bright and unexpected and evocative of a louche sybaritic age but there was something more basic more essential and at least theoretically more attainable about the oyster perpetual collection it sparked imitators left right and center and still does at last week s geneva watch days 2025 zenith s collaboration with swiss furniture maker usm would qualify as a textbook example a full set of bold block colour dials in otherwise traditional stainless steel sports watches earlier this year oris s big crown pointer date hit a similar note in 2023 arch rival omega debuted a collection of seamaster aqua terra models with similar hues to rolex s opening salvo other mid level brands including breitling and tag heuer have all created multi colored families of stainless steel time only round watches in a similar mold three years after rolex omega followed suit microbrands are in on the act too split watches immediately sold out of its just launched searingly all yellow sub 7 other brands have incorporated the idea into their own design language hublot gave us collections of block color ceramic watches taking the impact of a bright dial and flowing it into cases and bracelets alike you ll find the same principle at niche watchmakers like meistersinger and start ups like norqain it s subtle and doubtless many would deny the connection but it s undeniably a phenomenon that has exploded since 2020 in fact the trend has been so successful rolex even returned to it this year launching new versions of the oyster perpetual in lilac beige and pistachio green for years rolex communication was very stern very institutional says fabio ciquera an industry consultant who also teaches an ma course in luxury brand management at ravensbourne university its sponsorship reminded us of the establishment and elite these new designs play a strategic role as much as a collab between louis vuitton and murakami to inject newness into the brand these may play an anchor role in the mind of a new breed of clients who also value the unexpected more than the institutional then tag heuer joined the fray indeed rolex s dial designs have been more unexpected since the introduction of the 2020 collection with rapidly discontinued if not overtly limited editions such as the datejust with palm dial made using eye surgery lasers no less and the surprising controversial emoji day date from 2023 then there was the celebration or bubbles oyster perpetual a model that took all five colors from the origianl 2020 set and brought them together in one design also now discontinued ciquera explains that despite its market dominance there is a chance rolex might be feeling pressure to change its brand image its younger customers will feel reassured that their brand of choice is also fun and unexpected not just wimbledon and elite he says at the higher end of the spectrum we could say that rolex may have felt the pressure of fun design at brands like richard mille or interesting collabs between casablanca mad paris who created a bold multicolored audemars piguet royal oak and felt like a new take on fun would have benefit also especially considering the need of a renewed anchor to entice younger clients now zenith is launching a brightly hued collection with colors designed to pop the shift from incrementally building out a color range to introducing an entire palette in one drop brings additional design considerations each color must not only work in its own right but in conjunction with the others and the bubbles reference shows how carefully rolex constructed the palette to begin with as professor renzo shamey director of color science and imaging laboratories at the wilson college of textiles of north carolina state university explains different pigments and shades flare more than others which may partly explain why the 2020 collection felt so impactful and their harmonious interaction is dependent on factors such as relative size as well as theories of complementary colors oris s latest big crown takes its cues from the 2020 rolex collection as well color is influenced by the surrounding background and lighting and all sorts of things says shamey even when you control all of these variables it is highly subjective because our perception of color is a very personal experience from the point of production the question is how do we minimize issues associated with perceived color if you can generate it in an isolated environment that s all good and great but the color is going to sit in a context so how is that going to match in that environment correctly shamey says that a brand can come up with a color that matches another one perfectly in one scenario then change the setting and it doesn t match at all we call that metabolism he says a single color can flare or not match from one setting to the other while some colors are more color constant than others some purples or olives or some mixed like khakis if you change the illumination they can shift quite a bit while others are less susceptible microbrands such as split are taking the vivid color styling idea beyond just the dial across the watch industry brands have reached for this type of pastel shade recently with pale purples pistachio green and sandy beige popular beyond rolex s 2025 oyster perpetuals whether the shift from more constant solid emphatic colors to those more likely

read the full stories and stay safe out there in a jaw dropping new report bloomberg has obtained more than 18 000 emails from jeffrey epstein s personal yahoo account offering a raw and unsettling window into the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier s world and that of his longtime associate ghislaine maxwell the story reveals that maxwell and epstein remained deeply intertwined long after she claimed to have stepped away from his orbit the correspondence details her role in managing his finances property and personal relationships as well as efforts to discredit women who accused them of abuse among the revelations maxwell opened a foreign bank account using epstein s address was listed as a director at one of his main companies and even coordinated the distribution of luxury gifts to associates and victims alike the emails are a stark reminder of maxwell s complicity in epstein s crimes at a time when she is widely seen as courting favor with the trump administration beyond advising epstein on plea negotiations and scheming to discredit accusers maxwell appears to have remained the linchpin in his social network connecting him to politicians celebrities and business titans according to the emails reviewed by bloomberg the archive reveals her helping arrange gifts and payments from a 71 000 lexus for a lawyer to lingerie for teenage girls who later testified against them while simultaneously navigating her own mounting exposure against the background of trump officials weighing whether to release the sealed epstein files and speculation over a potential pardon the correspondence positions maxwell not only as epstein s fixer but someone who has long worked to secure her standing with those in power in a newly unsealed warrant reviewed by forbes immigration and customs enforcement was authorized to use a cell site simulator a controversial surveillance tool that tracks phones by mimicking real cell towers in an effort to locate a venezuelan national initial location data narrowed the man to a 30 block area prompting ice to request more precise tracking using the device it s unclear if he was ever caught the case highlights ice s reliance on surveillance tools long criticized by civil liberties groups for sweeping up swaths of data from bystanders alongside targets in may procurement records show ice spent nearly 1 million on cell site simulator vehicles building on a 2024 contract launched under the previous administration ice also reportedly maintains a 4 4 million deal with harris corporation maker of the notorious stingray which has become an eponym for nearly all cell site simulators used by law enforcement the devices work by tricking cell phones into believing they re real cell towers allowing police to identify a target device and track its movements far more precisely than the broad geolocation data available from phone companies while a normal trace may only provide a rough radius or general direction with a stingray and a few attachments police can shrink the search to a specific block home or apartment the devices are controversial because in certain modes they don t just capture the target s phone signal they scoop up data from every device in range sweeping up information about bystanders calls without their knowledge or consent a security advisory from the us department of transportation s federal highway administration said last month that highway infrastructure including chargers traffic cameras and roadside weather stations should be checked for hidden equipment the report said according to reuters that investigators have found undocumented cellular radios in some power inverters and battery management systems used for solar power in us highway equipment the warning comes as the us government has increasingly sounded the alarm in recent years about the risk of backdoors in chinese made equipment that could undermine us infrastructure the us treasury department sanctioned almost 20 companies and individuals in myanmar and cambodia this week for their alleged roles in the multibillion dollar global scam industry the swindles target victims around the world with investment romance and other digital confidence scams using the forced labor of human trafficking victims the us issued financial and diplomatic sanctions against nine entities in myanmar s shwe kokko city as well as 10 in cambodia in a release about the action john k hurley undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence said southeast asia s cyber scam

on friday tyler robinson a 22 year old utah native was identified by federal law enforcement as a suspect in the murder of charlie kirk during friday s press conference officials said that several bullet casings recovered from a hunting rifle found near the crime scene had messages inscribed on them during the press conference officials appeared to take the inscriptions literally to the extent they ascribed meaning to them at all but the four messages apparently written by the alleged shooter instead seem to invoke a variety of memes and video game references one of the casings was said to be engraved with the phrase hey fascist catch followed by an up arrow a right arrow and three downward facing arrows that sequence is an apparent reference to the eagle 500kg bomb in the popular third person shooter game helldivers 2 the bomb has become a meme in the helldivers community for being comically excessive arrowhead game studios the developers of helldivers 2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment from wired launched in 2024 the game has grown a cult following for its starship troopers like storyline the cooperative shooter allows teams of up to four players called helldivers to spread freedom across a fictional universe fighting bugs robots and squid like aliens rather than other humans their form of managed democracy is basically fascism says independent extremism researcher harry batchelor who works with the extremism and gaming research network helldivers 2 is satire and the vast majority of players are in on it the game says batchelor takes the whole pretending to be democracy while actually being a fascist government so seriously it s obviously a joke the community around the game has generally maintained a positive reputation even working together to combat review bombing coordinated negative reviews intended to hurt a game s chance of success the arrows that activate the eagle 500kg bomb have been used in other memes to show that a user is going to do a big violent action don caldwell editor in chief of know your meme tells wired that s maybe a cheeky way of expressing it on the casing shortly after the friday press conference about kirk s fatal shooting moderators locked the r helldivers subreddit due to recent events and the high amount of posts about the topic we will be locking the subreddit temporarily a post on the subreddit reads we re aware of what happened our modteam doesn t condone it helldivers may not be the only game reference on the casings another casing was allegedly engraved with lyrics to a famous italian folk song called bella ciao which translates directly to goodbye beautiful the song which has associations with postwar anti fascist movements in italy has seen a resurgence on social media in recent years notably bella ciao holds significance for rebel forces during a mission in far cry 6 a video game set on a fictional caribbean island ruled by a dictator a usb stick with the song is a collectible item labeled bella ciao de libertad a reference to the rebel group the in game description notes that the song has been inspiring guerrillas and partisans for over a century another alleged engraving on the casings was the quote notices bulges owo what s this an apparent reference to a furry related meme that was popularized in 2015 owo is an emoticon representing a form of cute surprise one of the other alleged memes on the casings says if you read this you are gay lmao which seems to be more of a common online insult than a specific reference i believe this person is genuinely just always online batchelor says they knew that they d be discovered and posted about says caldwell of the decision to include meme references on the casings people understand that memes are very powerful and get a lot of attention as soon as people read them they re going to desperately try to figure out what the reference means it makes it more interesting there has also been renewed focus on video games and violence recently on september 9 us health secretary robert f kennedy jr pointed to games as a possible contributor to school shootings but in the aftermath of this shooting and others like it alex newhouse a researcher at the university of colorado at boulder who studies extremism says any critiques of gaming culture in this instance must be contextualized it s not a specific game but it s rather the use of gaming references it s not the specific meme but rather the use of online memes he says it s not the specific ways that things are written on the gun but that they re writing something on the gun at all it s important to not read too deeply into any face value political meaning of the messages on the bullet casings newhouse says it s pretty indicative of general speech associated with the deep parts of internet culture in particular the types that are very much into irony posting and edgelord humor
for years extremist groups white nationalists and militias like the proud boys and oath keepers saw charlie kirk not as their ally but as their enemy though kirk denigrated trans people muslims unmarried women and many minorities and advocated for an america with christianity at the center of every aspect of life he was in their view a moderate for some his staunch support of israel s government made kirk a target rather than a friend but in the immediate aftermath of kirk being fatally shot while speaking at a turning point usa event wednesday at utah valley university in orem utah these same groups were quick to frame the incident as an attack on one of their own portraying kirk s death as part of what they see as an ongoing war against white christian men the same groups were relatively quiet on friday after police announced they had arrested a 22 year old from utah for the killing who had no obvious ties to the left these groups many of which have been relatively dormant since the mass arrests surrounding the january 6 attack on the capitol have used the outpouring of grief around kirk s death as a lightning rod a signal that they need to mobilize and take action many of them including the proud boys and oath keepers have used kirk s death as a recruitment and radicalizing tool to convince his supporters to take a more extreme worldview nothing can stop what is coming ryan s nchez the leader of the far right national network who was caught on video giving a nazi salute during last year s conservative political action conference wrote on his telegram channel we are mobilizing young nationalists to defend our communities against the radical left we need your help the appeals appear to be at least somewhat working s nchez s post was accompanied by a screenshot showing a 1 000 donation he received on christian crowdfunding platform givesendgo this is the beginning of a movement that may define our nation the donor wrote on the site use it for good and purge the country of these insane ideologies another donor who called himself white nationalist commented time to take our country back fellas get to work s nchez an acolyte of far right influencer nick fuentes has already mobilized a video from a vigil for kirk that s nchez promoted in huntington beach california on wednesday shows a group of men chanting white man fight back he shared another image of himself speaking at the vigil on his telegram channel with the caption death to the left the video of the chanting in huntington beach was shared in many other extremist groups including the anti communist combat hq channel on telegram which is a hub for amplifying antisemitic racist and anti lgbtq rhetoric from groups including active clubs and the national justice party the channel s operators highlighted just how useful a recruitment tool such events are those guys chanting in this video will probably have a dozen conversations each that will bring the conservatives around them a little closer to us and that is infinitely more valuable than purity spiraling on telegram they posted this latest instance of political violence is definitely acting as a clarion call for them to step up and try and get back to their pre j6 levels says luke baumgartner a research fellow at george washington university s program on extremism the biggest danger that we ll likely see is not necessarily the normies looking to join their ranks but those that are already on the cusp finally having their raison d tre to move from merely online chatter to irl action against their enemies both real and perceived within minutes of kirk s fatal shooting on wednesday far right influencers and extremists claimed the us was at war and that the shooter who was not identified until friday morning was a radical leftist a motive has not been determined these same figures turned their attention to those on the left they perceived to be celebrating kirk s death launching a nonstop campaign to get those people fired as wired reported thursday the effort also resulted in a lot of people receiving death threats with one victim telling wired they were moving their family out of their home the texas nationalist network a white nationalist group was among many who linked the murder of kirk to that of ukrainian woman iryna zarutska in charlotte north carolina last month calling them a turning point in the minds of many while many groups are talking about recruiting and radicalizing normies into their extremist groups others have unabashedly promoted further violence vigilante violence and retaliation will not solve this problem the operators of the proud boys ohio channel on telegram wrote on wednesday only massive top down state violence against evildoers will solve this problem the texas proud boys channel shared an image of a knight holding a flaming cross with the caption time to lock in followed by a video of nazi leader adolf hitler and the caption eye for an eye other proud boy chapters around the us shared similar sentiments and two proud boys showed up to an impromptu vigil for kirk in utah on wednesday evening enrique tarrio the onetime leader of the proud boys who had his 22 year sentence for seditious conspiracy with regards to the january 6 capitol riot pardoned by trump earlier this year says the group is focused right now on outing those who he believes are publicly celebrating kirk s death many within the proud boy movement have disavowed tarrio and his leadership the proud boys are focusing our efforts into these threats and celebrations tarrio tells wired we will not call for violence but we will inform their employers of who they have on staff many proud boy channels and accounts online are filled with members outing those they believe were celebrating kirk s death sharing links to a website that has become the hub for this campaign we re not fucking around anymore tarrio added just hours after kirk was shot oath keepers founder stewart rhodes who had his sentence for seditious conspiracy with regards to the january 6 capitol riot commuted by trump earlier this year announced on infowars that the shooting was the inspiration he needed to restart his militia organization i m going to be rebuilding the oath keepers and we will be doing protection again said rhodes if my security team had been at that event if they had been up there on the high point looking for potential threats they would have saved charlie kirk from being shot rhodes added that he was already in the process of preparing a written proposal for the trump administration about how it could activate militias across the country rhodes is urging men between the ages of 17 and 45 to come together in their communities and form vigilante groups to protect the people of the county to secure their neighborhoods their public transportation to stop terrorist attacks the morning after rhodes broadcast jessica watkins a former oath keeper and convicted insurrectionist wrote on x charlie kirk s assassination pulled me out of retirement more work must be done while some researchers believe tarrio and rhodes are more interested in profiting from renewed interest in their movements others are concerned about further political violence to see two of the groups that led one of the most significant acts of political violence in american history returning to a violence embracing pre january 6th posture should give us all pause says devin burghart executive director of the institute for research education on human rights

that s unfortunately slipped further and further down my to play list i m still hoping to carve out time to properly check it out before it s time to start putting together our games of the year list popucom which debuted on steam earlier this year also looks pretty intriguing from hypergryph and publisher gryph frontier this is a multiplayer only adventure platformer in which you take out enemies with match three style shooting here s the twist each player only has two colors so you ll need to work together to fire the correct blobs at bad guys and obstacles popucom is coming to switch this

on steam and it usually costs 10 but there s a 10 percent discount until september 23 disc golf feels like it would be a fun sport to get into and while there are a few courses near me they re not exactly easy to get to without a car so i might just have to make do with disc golf city which came out of early access on steam for pc mac and linux this week the action takes place in a colorful city and you can bounce your disc off of objects in the environment to pull off trick shots and try to land it in the basket disc golf city which is from agapo games costs 13 there s also a demo you can check out another game that came out of early access on steam and gog this week is beyond sunset this is a cyberpunk not that one first person shooter with rpg elements from metacorp vaporware and publisher movie games i love when a vaporwave color palette is put to good use and the lo fi visuals here just feel right the fast paced movement looks pretty interesting too it s not hard to tell that the developers took inspiration from the doom series beyond sunset costs 10 it feels like i can t go on the internet for five minutes without learning about a new sidescrolling metroidvania game still katanaut is one i ve had my eye on for a while you ll be facing the horrors that have taken over a space station using an array of weapons skills and perks this is a roguelite from voidmaw in

also revealed this week that acclaim is the publisher of katanaut which is available on steam pacific drive was one of the more interesting looking games from last year that i just haven t gotten around to checking out yet it s a driving sim and survival horror game set in a supernatural version of the pacific northwest in which you scour the landscape for parts to upgrade your car and hopefully stay alive ironwood studios and publisher kepler interactive this week announced the whispers in the woods expansion for pacific drive slated to arrive later this year the dlc adds around eight to 12 hours of gameplay with new characters dangers mysteries and anomalies to encounter other updates include route modifiers and garage cosmetics to find the rest of this week s upcoming games

and dungeon crawling gridbeat will see you infiltrate a corporate computer network and try to escape with valuable data while security programs and malware attempt to stop you you ll find more abilities and power ups along the way crucially you need to move in time to the music since it s a rhythm game as well there s a lot going on here gridbeat is coming to steam but there s no release window as yet one thing i was really hoping to see during acclaim s showcase was the return of nba jam we didn t quite get that but i ll absolutely take basketball classics in its place acclaim has taken over publishing duties for this retro nes style arcade basketball title from namo gamo it features 5 on 5 sidescrolling action with simplified controls hundreds of teams more than 1 000 players and multiple modes including couch multiplayer i hadn t heard of basketball classics until now but it s been out on steam for several years acclaim is helping to bring it to consoles sometime soon i do love powerwash simulator and am looking forward to the sequel pixel washer looks like a different flavor of that format as a cute lil piggy with a power washer you ll be cleaning just about everything in sight the trailer suggests that things might get weird and it even seems like there are boss fights valadria is the developer behind pixel washer which is coming to steam down the line hyperyuki snowboard syndicate looks like the offspring of ssx and jet set radio and that s enough to sell me on the game an easy addition to my wishlist wabisabi design is making this snowboarding game that pits you against npcs and or human players in races in the main game mode you ll need to complete a certain number of challenges in each level before you can move on which is very much keeping in with the tony hawk s pro skater format there s also a relaxing endless mode where you can just hang out and explore or like whatever hyperyuki snowboard syndicate supports split screen play and online multiplayer for up to eight people again there s no confirmed release date or window as yet this one is coming to steam acclaim notes that it is actively exploring console releases for its

event will take a slightly different format than in the past mark zuckerberg is scheduled to kick things off with an evening keynote at 5pm pt on wednesday september 17 a developer keynote with other executives will take place the next morning on september 18 beginning at 10am with more talks and developer sessions to follow it s not clear why meta changed things up this year but it is shaping up to be a particularly eventful year for connect we re expecting two new models of smart glasses including meta s first to have a display as well as new meta ai and metaverse updates as usual engadget will be reporting live from zuckerberg s keynote at meta hq but until then here s a closer look at what s coming and what to keep an eye on the biggest news of the day will be meta s next generation of smart glasses the frames often referred to by their reported internal name hypernova will be the first consumer ready glasses from meta that have a display we already know quite a bit about these thanks to more than a year of leaks while the frames are expected to have a small display on one side they won t offer the kind of immersive augmented reality experience we ve seen on meta s orion prototype instead the display will allow you to view things like notifications and photo previews the glasses will also come with a dedicated wristband similar to what the company showed off with orion that allows the wearer to control specific features through hand gestures the glasses which may officially be called celeste are expected to go on sale later this year will likely cost around 800 they could be sold with prada branding which would be in line with meta s longtime essilorluxottica partnership according to cnbc given the much higher price tag most of meta s ray ban branded glasses cost around 300 it seems meta is positioning this as a higher end product that will have a more limited appeal analyst ming chi kuo has suggested hypernova will have a negligible share of the overall smart glasses market it also sounds like we could see a new version of meta s smart glasses without a display with an updated version of the ray ban meta smart glasses there could be two versions for sunglasses and clear frames according to leaked renders the new glasses are reported to have improved cameras and battery life and support new ai capabilities we could also see new third party glasses integrations as uploadvr recently pointed out early versions of the connect schedule for developers seemingly confirms that meta is getting ready to give developers access to its smart glasses up to now the ray ban meta and oakley glasses have mostly been limited to apps within meta s ecosystem with a few exceptions like spotify and audible allowing more developers to start experimenting with the platform could bring even more functionality to the existing lineup of glasses as with other recent years ai will be a major theme throughout meta ai has a billion monthly users something zuckerberg will surely remind us of and i m expecting to see new features for meta ai both on the company s glasses and within its apps business insider reports the company has been working on new lineup of non english speaking character driven bots for its apps meta s character centric chatbots have also faced scrutiny with the company recently blocking teens access to many user generated characters amid growing safety concerns outside of meta s chatbots i m hoping zuckerberg will talk more about his vision to create superintelligence as i wrote in july his initial manifesto that outlined his vision was confusing at best the ceo has recently reorganized meta s ai teams around the idea and has been on a very expensive hiring spree to recruit executives and researchers for the effort at the same time zuckerberg could use connect to shore up expectations around its llama models the company s larger llama 4 model has been delayed and reports suggest meta s engineers have been struggling to improve it there are other signs that zuckerberg may be backing away from open source ai while the metaverse has taken somewhat of a backseat to ai in recent years it wouldn t be connect without some vr related news in a recent instagram post meta cto andrew bosworth teased metaverse software updates related to horizon worlds at connect the company recently offered a preview to developers of its plan to bring ai powered npcs to the metaverse and i expect we ll hear more about how generative ai could help shape the metaverse and while there are no new quest headsets expected we could hear more about those third party vr headsets that will run meta s vr software last year the company announced that asus lenovo and xbox were working on meta horizon os headsets we haven t heard too much about these devices since but there was a leak earlier this year that suggested asus would be the first to launch and that it would include face and eye tracking features new details on the upcoming asus rog vr headset running meta horizon os it is codenamed tarius and will likely be one of the first 3p horizon os hmds to ship it is planned to include eye tracking and face tracking the displays will be qd lcd with local dimming or oled pic twitter com k5pyxcbk4h luna lunayian january 12 2025 another intriguing possibility is an update on meta s holographic codec avatars we got a glimpse of last year while meta s current lineup of vr headsets don t have the necessary face and eye tracking sensors to support the tech uploadvr suggests meta could show off a more rudimentary version of the avatars that could run on the quest 3 or even work in conjunction with video calls on whatsapp and messenger
instagram fixed a bug that caused the reach of some users stories to shrink when they posted more than one story a day instagram head adam mosseri shared on friday the fix addresses a common complaint shared by creators in the last year that they were disincentivized to use stories because of how regularly using the feature impacted the number of people who actually saw their posts people were complaining about getting less reach with their stories if they posted lots of stories in the same day mosseri said in a video announcing the change that is not at all the intended behavior of instagram fixing the bug doesn t mean every story you add will be watched but mosseri says posting multiple stories a day won t negatively impact the reach of your stories overall especially your first story for anyone who primarily uses instagram to keep up with their friends the change might not matter all that much but much like youtube instagram is an increasingly professionalized platform where people post in the hopes of expanding their reach and earning a living off their content that creates an interesting dynamic between mosseri s regular announcements and users trying to suss out the nuances of the platform s algorithm for every new feature like adding of comments to stories there s subtler tweaks that can totally change creators content strategy
fans will have to wait a little bit longer for the hotly anticipated balatro 1 1 update developer localthunk just announced it will not be coming out in 2025 despite previously promising a release this year instead it ll come out when it s done it s worth remembering that balatro was created by a single person and the same goes for this update the lone developer also made the original balance patch and the well regarded mobile port he says he s well and truly burned out localthunk apologizes for the delay and says it has become clear now that it won t happen by the end of the year it s actually nice to let us know now instead of forcing us to wonder where the update is for the next several months i still consider this my hobby he wrote the prospect of rushing the work and going back into crunch mode to get it out this year just felt terrible now for some good news the update is definitely coming just not right now it ll be free for all players on all platforms the developer also hinted that this update would not be the final dlc drop for the game for the uninitiated balatro is a deckbuilding roguelike that s loosely based on poker consider it the highly addictive sequel to poker we never knew we needed it has proven to be a bona fide phenomenon
an ipad might be the most versatile apple device you can buy they can run apps and games like your phone yet they re as powerful as some laptops you can use them to read books like on an ereader or watch shows like its a mini tv but they re not the cheapest tablets out there so it s wise to look for sales when you can find them you won t see discounts directly from apple but amazon target best buy and b h photo often offer discounts on apple s slates all week long we keep an eye out for deals on tech and we ve rounded up the best ipad deals we could find right here we also threw in a few deals on other apple gear that were too good not to mention apple the new base model ipad now comes with twice the storage of the previous model plus the a16 chip that makes the most affordable ipad faster and more capable but still isn t enough to support apple intelligence we didn t find that to be a problem and awarded it an 84 in our review calling it plenty quick for reading watching and playing things with solid battery life and an eternally easy to use os amazon has sold it at this price for a few months now though it went as low as 280 during amazon prime day also at best buy walmart and costco apple ipad pro 11 inch m4 for 899 100 off the ipad pro is much more tablet than most people need but it s the ultimate ipad for those who can stomach its price tag it s wonderfully thin its oled display is one of the best we ve seen on a consumer device and its m4 chip can handle virtually anything you d ever do on an ipad it s also the only apple tablet with face id and it has a better speaker setup than the ipad air we gave it a score of 84 in our review with the only real drawback being its price also at b h or bj s for 20 less if you have a membership there apple airpods pro 2 for 199 50 off now that the airpods pro 3 is open for pre orders the pro 2 model isn t likely to be around much longer but there s no telling when the new version will see a discount the third gen earbuds do have a bunch of new features but if you don t need the latest model you may be perfectly happy with the second generation buds we gave them an 88 in our review and they held a top spot in our best earbud guide for years apple watch series 10 gps only 46 mm for 429 70 off this is another apple device that s soon to be gone from the shelves but it s worth noting that the new series 11 and this model have the same hardware design though the new one has a tougher screen and both use the same processor chip we named the series 10 the best smartwatch you can buy just expect it to be usurped by the new generation and gave it a 90 in our review but if you want the latest watch the apple watch series 11 is open for pre orders now apple earpods for 16 3 off some people prefer a wire with their earbuds if that s you you can snag these for just 16 which makes it one of the cheapest apple branded items you can get they don t have the bells and whistles of the new airpods pro 3 but they re far more affordable apple airtags 4 pack for 75 24 off we may see an updated model by the end of 2025 but the current airtags are the best bluetooth trackers for iphone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultrawide band features that make it easy to locate things that re close by just note that you ll need a separate airtag holder to attach them to your keys wallet or bag this isn t a great deal for a four pack the bundle was available for 70 last week and 65 during amazon s prime day but it s still a bit lower than the four pack s list price also at best buy and walmart apple 35w dual usb c port adapter for 39 20 off it s always good to have a few extra ports around this is the adapter that ships with the m4 with 10 core gpu macbook air and it can quickly charge ipads iphones and anything else powered by usb c too walmart is also selling apple s 2 meter fast charge cable for 23 6 off read more apple coverage the best airpods the best apple watches the best macbooks the best iphones the best ipads follow engadgetdeals on x for the latest tech deals and buying advice

from the showcase including what s obviously the most important one a switch 2 version of overcooked 2 september 13 is the 40th anniversary of super mario bros in japan which is a big reason why this

simulation game you ll play as a ditto who has been transformed to look like a human and turn empty land into a cozy paradise for both yourself and pok mon ditto can learn abilities from pok mon such as using squirtle s water gun to give life to flora it looks utterly lovely pok mon pokopia is coming to switch 2 in 2026 nintendo used this direct to seriously start filling out its switch 2 slate for 2026 one of the games it s publishing for the system next year is a new entry in the fire emblem series it announced fire emblem fortune s weave during the showcase as ever this will be a turn based tactical rpg the debut trailer touched on the story and characters in the upcoming game we had a feeling these were coming soon but release dates for both metroid prime 4 beyond and hades 2 were both major announcements during the direct samus has a rad tron esque bike in metroid prime 4 beyond which will arrive on switch and switch 2 on december 4 hades 2 meanwhile will arrive on switch and switch 2 on september 25 the full game will be available on steam and epic games store on the same day as it will exit early access on pc there were be cross save support across pc and switch switch 2 the switch 2 version will support 120fps gameplay when the console is docked that hades 2 and hollow knight silksong are dropping in the same month is pretty wild apologies to any designs you had on

slash game it s coming to the console on november 6 age of imprisonment which was developed by koei tecmo s aaa games studio sees princess zelda traveling back in time and meeting rauro and sonia the

coming to switch 2 it ll arrive on february 27 the same day the next entry in capcom s classic survival horror series debuts on other platforms resident evil 7 biohazard and resident evil village will also land on switch on on february 27 we learned back in april that the first installment of the final fantasy vii remake trilogy was bound for switch 2 and now there s a release date for that final fantasy vii remake intergrade is coming to the system on january 22 the nintendo switch was such an important platform for indie games and several that became huge hits are getting switch 2 versions overcooked 2 the ultimate relationship test in my opinion will have support for 4k visuals 60fps gameplay gameshare and cameraplay the feature that allows you to see you and your teammate s faces on screen as you play in its switch 2 version that s on the way this holiday season stardew valley will also support gameshare for co op play on switch 2 mouse controls will be available as well as four player splitscreen and eight player online action those who have the game on switch already will get a free upgrade when the switch 2 version arrives this fall human fall flat is headed to switch 2 in spring 2026 that will also have support for mouse controls gameshare and eight person multiplayer it s far too early to say whether powerwash simulator 2 will become an indie classic but the original game was terrific and its sequel is getting a switch 2 version as well there s no exact release date for powerwash simulator 2 as yet but it s still slated to arrive this fall suika game was a huge hit and the sequel promises to soak up even more of my time suika game planet adds an extra dimension to the puzzle action instead of dropping fruit into a bucket and trying to combine two of the same items into a larger one this time there s a circular stage that might be a fun wrinkle for anyone me hi who gets frustrated about not being able to reach large fruit at the bottom of the container suika game planet is coming to switch and switch 2 this winter and i might not be able to do anything else with my time after it drops the switch 2 version will support a gameshare mode that allows up to four players to work together last but not least nintendo had an absolute shocker when it came to switch online expansion pack no it s not adding super mario sunshine to the gamecube app just yet the company is bringing virtual boy games to the service which is more bananas than anything you ll find in donkey kong bananza to play those games from a system that was notoriously undercooked partly because nintendo was placing much more focus on the massively more successful nintendo 64 around that time you ll need an accessory a 100 plastic tabletop one that looks just like the original virtual boy and a 25 cardboard version are on the way they re compatible with the nintendo switch switch 2 and if it s an authentic virtual boy experience probably some eye strain
it s official the switch 2 is getting the next entry in the long running fire emblem series fire emblem fortune s weave will be available sometime in 2026 though we have nothing more specific than that we do have a trailer and it looks gorgeous it showed off the game s tactical combat which is a mainstay for the franchise and teased the story it involves some sort of gladiator like contest called the heroic games there are plenty of new combat units and many of them boast gladiatorial flair of some kind it also looks to take place in the same universe as the immensely popular fire emblem three houses which came out for the original switch console there are some visual similarities and one character seems to be a grown up version of someone from three houses this makes a certain kind of sense given that three houses is the most financially successful game in franchise history and considered by critics to be a stone cold classic the more recent fire emblem engage wasn t nearly as popular despite being a solid entry for the uninitiated this series is all about tactical turn based combat factional rivalries and robust storylines involving numerous characters it was a niche franchise here in the usa until the 3ds era and the release of fire emblem awakening and fire emblem fates
the federal trade commission is investigating whether amazon and google misled advertisers regarding the pricing and terms for their ads as first reported by bloomberg the investigation is being conducted by the agency s consumer protection unit and centers around the auction style sale of advertising space by the companies google sells ads using automated auctions that run after a user enters a search query these auctions take place in less than a second amazon uses real time auctions to place ads within its listings which users would recognize as sponsored listings or sponsored ads when searching for specific products the investigation questions whether amazon disclosed so called reserve pricing for some of its ads which is a price floor that advertisers must meet before they can buy an ad for google s part the ftc is looking at certain practices by the search giant including its internal pricing process and whether it was surreptitiously increasing the cost of ads in ways that advertisers weren t privy to the ftc isn t the only federal agency keeping a close eye on big tech earlier this year a federal judge ruled that google held a monopoly in online ad tech after the department of justice doj sued to break up the giant s ad business google also recently escaped mostly unscathed from a department of justice monopoly case involving its chrome browser ftc chair andrew ferguson has previously said that big tech is one of the agency s top priorities these investigations move forward against a backdrop of top tech ceos continuing to try to curry favor with president trump via lavish personal gifts and sweeping if potentially unrealistic promises of investment in the us economy
final fantasy vii remake intergrade comes out for the switch 2 on january 22 2026 which was revealed at today s lengthy nintendo direct livestream this is the first entry in the remake trilogy and primarily takes place in the opening city of midgar you ll have to wait until final fantasy vii rebirth to explore the overworld map and there s no switch 2 release date for that one yet this release does include the episode intermission dlc which involves the ninja yuffie on a mission to steal powerful items from the evil shinra corporation that story takes place after the main campaign there s a trailer and it looks gorgeous so the switch 2 should be able to handle this one final fantasy vii remake intergrade originally came out back in 2021 the long awaited title was more of a reimagining than a straight remake of the iconic jrpg the game still managed to garner critical acclaim despite drastic changes from the original it was followed by final fantasy vii rebirth in 2024 with a third game on the way to close out the trilogy there s no name for this final entry and we don t have a release date as it s still in active development
a square camera sensor may sound like one of those things only nerds would appreciate but as part of the new front facing 18 megapixel center stage camera on the iphone 17 lineup it could have massive implications for apple s users they ll no longer need to turn their phones to take a landscape selfie especially if they need to fit a large group of people as that s all handled automatically by center stage it s the sort of why didn t i think of that feature that other phone makers will likely copy simply because it s immensely practical those square camera sensors could help make apple a selfie pioneer once again we ve come a long way from when the iphone 4 and htc evo 4g introduced the idea of modern front facing cameras in 2010 earlier cellphones in japan and europe had low quality selfie cameras and you could argue that the game boy camera also toyed with the idea when it arrived in 1998 but in 2010 we finally had powerful phones on relatively speedy mobile connections that could easily share photos and let users hop on video chats on a whim it still stings that it took apple two more years to release the lte capable iphone 5 which made facetime much more useful during the iphone 17 launch event apple revealed that its customers took 500 billion selfies last year a massive figure that shows just how normalized the practice has become selfies were often mocked when they were deemed the purview of instagram obsessed teenage girls but these days it s not unusual to see everyone from seniors to a gaggle of sports bros gathering around a single phone like an object of worship and on a personal note they re really the only way to get decent photos of your entire family especially when you re juggling two rambunctious young kids we take photos to preserve memories but selfies feel distinctive for their intimacy you re not just capturing where you were but you re also documenting yourself in the moment along with the people around you by making it easier to take selfies it follows that you ll start to take even more of them ultimately tying yourself into apple s ecosystem even further that leads to needing an iphone with more storage and potentially more icloud backup space down the line you re also not going to jump over to an android phone if you have to turn your phone sideways for a landscape selfie or if you lose access to all of the cherished memories in your apple photos library the square camera sensor keeps you loyal it ll also change the way iphone users take front facing videos center stage automatically keeps you in the center of facetime calls so you don t have to worry so much about framing yourself up and while i haven t seen this particular feature in action it should also help alleviate the headache of turning your phone during a facetime call to match the recipient s device or maybe i m just tired of telling my parents to flip their phones when their facetime chats have huge black borders this may be a stretch but i could see the center stage front camera making it more common to record video with your front and rear cameras at the same time while it s new to iphone as dual capture we ve seen variants of it from samsung and nokia remember bothie android devices but they ve never really taken off tiktok s dual camera live streaming mode has been more successful and there are also vlogging apps like mixcam built around dual recording with dual capture on iphone 17 center stage s ability to keep you in the middle of the action with the front camera should let you focus more on getting the best shot with the rear lenses while i d love to see apple cram more pixels into the 18mp center stage camera moving to a square sensor will honestly be more impactful for all of the reasons above it s easy to throw in a higher resolution sensor it s tougher to fundamentally rethink how you can improve upon something as simple as taking a selfie the apple awe dropping event has concluded after the company announced new iphones apple watch and airpods models as expected the full rundown of new releases the iphone 17 iphone air and i phone 17 pro and pro max the airpods pro 3 with live translation and a heart rate sensor and the apple watch se 3 apple watch series 11 and apple watch ultra 3 the company also confirmed that all of its new operating system upgrades including ios 26 will be available as free upgrades on september 15 scroll through engadget s earlier live coverage of the iphone 17 launch to see how the announcements unfolded throughout the day
in one of the most unexpected announcements of today s nintendo direct game freak revealed pok mon pokopia a game that is clearly inspired by the animal crossing series when pokopia is released sometime next year you ll assume the role of a ditto determined to make a comfortable home for their friends this ditto has assumed the form of a human and as they meet new pok mon they ll learn abilities they can use to transform their community in turn this work will lead to more pok mon coming to live in your home the game features a beautiful tilt shift art style that is reminiscent of pok mon s third generation of games that debuted on the game boy advance no word yet on an exact release date but the game will be a switch 2 exclusive

push to revive nuclear energy relies on deregulation experts say strategy is misplaced i n may president donald trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology the orders aim to cut red tape ease approval processes and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency the nuclear regulatory commission or nrc these moves the administration said were part of an effort to achieve american independence from foreign power providers by way of a nuclear energy renaissance self reliance isn t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration following a decades long trend away from nuclear energy in part due to safety concerns and high costs the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change through nuclear fission in which atoms are split to release energy reactors don t emit any greenhouse gases the trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector s domestic energy production with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050 to help achieve that goal scientific institutions like the idaho national laboratory a leading research institute in nuclear energy are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector for example westinghouse a pennsylvania based nuclear power company plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal however the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles nuclear energy infrastructure is too expensive to build and it takes too long to build said allison macfarlane a science and technology policy expert at the university of british columbia who used to chair the nrc from 2012 to 2014 and experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies such as small versions of reactors are ready for primetime the nuclear energy field is now in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations said edwin lyman the director of nuclear power safety at the union of concerned scientists a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog meanwhile the trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the nrc lyman said the message is that it s regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power and if we just get rid of all this red tape then the industry is going to thrive he added i think that s really misplaced although streamlining the approval process might accelerate development the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas said koroush shirvan a nuclear science researcher at the massachusetts institute of technology even the license ready reactors are still not economical he said if the newer reactor technologies do pan out without government support and subsidies shirvan said it is difficult to imagine them coming online before 2035 r umblings of a nuclear renaissance give experts a sense of d j vu the first resurgence in interest was around 2005 when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels but that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the fukushima accident in 2011 in which a tsunami triggered power outage along with multiple safety failures led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in japan so the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out said lyman globally the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling although there has been an increase in generation nuclear energy has contributed less to the share of global electricity demand dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001 in the us 94 reactors generate about a fifth of the nation s electricity a proportion that has held steady since 1990s but only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years this renewed push is a second bite at the apple and we ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now said lyman much of that movement comes from the private sector said todd allen a nuclear engineer at the university of michigan in the last couple of decades dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged including terrapower co founded by bill gates it feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear allen said those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field proponents say small modular reactors or smrs and microreactors which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts respectively could offer safer cheaper and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts large reactors have on average 900 megawatts of capacity one 2022 study found that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent these designs have taken the spotlight in 2024 a report estimated that the smr market would reach 295 billion by 2043 in june energy secretary chris wright told congress that doe will have at least three smrs running by july of next year and in july of this year the nuclear energy agency launched a dashboard to track smr technologies around the world which identified 74 smr designs at different stages around the world the first commercial smr in north america is currently being constructed in canada with plans to be operational by 2030 but whether smrs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost effective remains to be determined a 2022 study found that smrs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors studying them though is difficult since so few are currently operational in part that may be because of cost multiple analyses have concluded that because of rising construction and operating costs smrs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world s energy markets including in developing countries that lack affordable access to electricity and recent ventures have hit road bumps for example nuscale the only smr developer with a design approved by the nrc had to shut down its operations in november 2023 due to increasingly high costs though another uprated smr design was approved earlier this year nothing is really commercialized yet said macfarlane most of the tech companies haven t figured out expenses supply chains the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors she added fuel supply is also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates but smrs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels which is typically sourced from russia and not commercially available in the us so scientists at the idaho national laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new more cost effective fuels said jess gehin the associate laboratory director for the nuclear science technology directorate at the inl they are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems he added we got to reach 400 gigawatts we need to accelerate all of this companies are determined to face and surpass these barriers some have begun pouring concrete such as one nuclear company called kairos power that began building a demo of their smr design in tennessee the plant is projected to be fully operational by 2027 i would make the case that we re moving faster than many in the field if not the fastest mike laufer the company s ceo and co founder told reuters last year some experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done and revel in the progress so far i would have never thought we d be in this position where we re working so hard to expand nuclear because for most of my career it wasn t that way said gehin and i would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming a lthough the trump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders in practice it has not allocated new funding yet said matt bowen an expert on nuclear energy waste and nonproliferation at columbia university s center on global energy policy in fact the initial white house budget proposed cutting 4 7 billion from the department of energy including 408 million from the office of nuclear energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year the administration was proposing cuts to office of nuclear energy and doe more broadly and doge is pushing staff out said bowen how do you do more with less less staff less money the trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector s stagnation on the nrc which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance in his executive orders trump called for a major reorganization of the nrc some of the proposed changes like streamlining the approval process which can take years for new plants may be welcomed because for a long time they were very very very slow said charles forsberg a nuclear chemical engineer at mit but there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape every word in those orders is of concern because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the nuclear regulatory commission of its independence from the executive branch essentially nullifying the original purpose said lyman some experts fear that with these new constraints nrc staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs which could impact power plant safety in the future bowen said this notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation and so all we need to do is deregulate is both wrong and also really problematic the next few decades will tell whether nuclear especially smrs can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts some like gehin are optimistic i think we re going to accelerate he said we certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it but making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies with many still skeptical shirvan said i am quite i would say on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the us this article was originally published on undark read the original article
it s that level of risk that they were taking i think that s what really hit home six decades have now passed since some of the most iconic project gemini spaceflights the 60th anniversary of gemini 4 when ed white conducted the first us spacewalk came in june the next mission gemini 5 ended just two weeks ago in 1965 these missions are now forgotten by most americans as most of the people alive during that time are now deceased however during these early years of spaceflight nasa engineers and astronauts cut their teeth on a variety of spaceflight firsts flying a series of harrowing missions during which it seems a miracle that no one died because the gemini missions as well as nasa s first human spaceflight program mercury yielded such amazing stories i was thrilled to realize that a new book has recently been published gemini mercury remastered that brings them back to life in vivid color the book is a collection of 300 photographs from nasa s mercury and gemini programs during the 1960s in which andy saunders has meticulously restored the images and then deeply researched their background to more fully tell the stories behind them the end result is a beautiful and powerful reminder of just how brave america s first pioneers in space were what follows is a lightly edited conversation with saunders about how he developed the book and some of his favorite stories from it ars why put out a book on mercury and gemini now andy saunders well it s the 60th anniversaries of the gemini missions but the book is really the prequel to my first book apollo remastered this is about the missions that came before so it takes us right back to the very dawn of human space exploration back to the very beginning and this was always a project i was going to work on next because as well as being obviously very important in spaceflight history they re very important in terms of human history the human evolution even you know the first time we were able to escape earth for tens of thousands of years civilizations have looked up and dreamt of leaving earth and voyaging to the stars and this golden era in the early 1960s is when that ancient dream finally became a reality also of course the first opportunity to look back at earth and give us that unique perspective but i think it s really the photographs specifically that will just forever symbolize and document at the beginning of our expansion out into the cosmos you know of course we went to the moon with apollo we ll go back with artemis we spent long periods on the international space station we ll walk on mars we ll eventually become a multi planetary species but this is where it all began and how it all began ars they used modified hasselblad cameras during apollo to capture these amazing images what types of cameras were used during mercury and gemini saunders mercury was more basic cameras so on the very first missions nasa didn t want the astronaut to take a camera on board the capsules were tiny they were very busy they re very short missions obviously very groundbreaking missions so the first couple of missions there was a camera out of the porthole window just taking photographs automatically but it was john glenn on his mission mercury atlas 6 who said no i want to take a camera people want to know what it s going to be like to be an astronaut they re going to want to look at earth through the window i m seeing things no humans ever seen before so he literally saw a 40 camera in a drugstore on his way after a haircut at cocoa beach he thought that s perfect and he bought it himself and then nasa adapted it they put a pistol grip on to help him to use it and with it he took the first still photographs of earth from space so it was the early astronauts that kind of drove the desire to take cameras themselves but they were quite basic wally schirra mercury atlas 8 then took the first hasselblad he wanted medium format better quality but really the photographs from mercury aren t as stunning as gemini it s partly the windows and the way they took the photos and they d had little experience also preservation clearly wasn t high up on the agenda in mercury because the original film is evidently in a pretty bad state the first american in space is an incredibly important moment in history but every single frame of the original film of alan shepard s flight was scribbled over with felt pen it s torn and it s fixed with like a piece of sticky tape but it s a reminder that these weren t taken for their aesthetic quality they weren t taken for posterity you know they were technical information the us was trying to catch up with the soviets preservation wasn t high up on the agenda ars i want to understand your process how many photos did you consider for this book saunders with apollo they took about 35 000 photographs with mercury and gemini there were about 5 000 which i was quite relieved about so yeah i went through all 5 000 they took i m not sure how much 16 millimeter film in terms of time because it was at various frame rates but a lot of 16 millimeter film so i went through every frame of film that was captured from launch to splashdown on every mission ars out of that material how much did you end up processing saunders what i would first do is have a quick look particularly if there s apparently nothing in them because a lot of them are very underexposed but with digital processing like i did with the cover of the apollo book we can pull out stuff that you actually can t see in the raw file so it s always worth taking a look so do a very quick edit and then if it s not of interest it s discarded or it might be that clearly an important moment was happening even if it s not a particularly stunning photograph i would save that one so i was probably down from 5 000 to maybe 800 and then do a better edit on it and then the final 300 that are in the book are those that are either aesthetically stunning or they re a big transformation or they show something important that happened on the mission or a historically significant moment but also what i want to do with the book as well as showing the photographs is tell the stories these incredible human stories that because of the risks they were taking so to do that i effectively reconstructed every mission from launch to splashdown by using lots of different pieces of information in order to effectively map the photography onto a timeline so that it can then tell the story through the captions so a photograph might be in there simply to help tell part of the story ars what was your favorite story to tell saunders well perhaps in terms of a chapter and a mission i d say gemini 4 is kind of the heart of the book you know first us space walk quite a lot of drama occurred when they couldn t close the hatch there s some quite poignant shots particularly of ed white of course who later lost his life in the apollo 1 fire but in terms of the story i mean gemini 9a was just there needs to be a movie about just gemini 9a right from the start from losing the prime crew and then just what happened out on gene cernan s eva how he got back into the capsule alive is quite incredible and all this detail i ve tried to cover because he took his camera so he called it the spacewalk from hell everything that could go wrong went wrong he was incredibly exhausted overheated his visor steamed over he went effectively blind and he was at the back of the adapter section this is at a point when nasa just hadn t mastered eva so simply how you maneuver in space they just haven t mastered so he was exhausted he was almost blind then he lost communication with tom stafford his command pilot he tore his suit because of course back then there were all kinds of jagged parts on the spacecraft and then when he s finally back in the hatch he was quite a big chap and they couldn t close the hatch so he was bent double trying to close the hatch he started to see stars he said tom if we don t close this hatch now and re pressurize i am going to die they got it closed got his helmet off and tom stafford said he just looked like someone that had spent far too long in a sauna stafford sprayed him with a water hose to kind of cool him down so what happened on that mission is just quite incredible but there was something on every mission you know from gus grissom sinking of the liberty bell and him almost drowning the heat shield coming loose or an indicator that suggested the heat shield was loose on glenn s mission there s an image of that in the book like i said i mapped everything to the timeline and worked out the frame rates and we ve got the clock we can see over his shoulder so i could work out exactly when he was at the point of maximum heating through reentry when part of the strapping that kept the retro pack on to try and hold a heat shield on that hit the window and he s talking but no one was listening because it was during radio blackout the process i used for this on the low quality 16 mm film was to stack hundreds and hundreds of frames to bring out incredible detail you can almost see the pores in his skin to see this level of detail to me it s just like a portrait of courage there he is holding steadfast not knowing if he s about to burn up in the atmosphere so that was quite a haunting image if you like to be able to help you step on board you know these tiny mercury spacecraft to see them to see what they saw to look out the windows and see how they saw it ars what was new or surprising to you as you spent so much time with these photos and looking at the details saunders the human side to them now that we can see them this clearly they seem to have an emotional depth to them and it s that level of risk that they were taking i think that s what really hit home the earth shots are stunning you know you can almost feel the scale particularly with a super wide lens and the altitudes they flew to and you can just imagine what it must have been like out on an eva for example i think gene cernan said it was like sitting on god s front porch the view he had on his eva so those earth shots are stunning but it s really those the human side that really hits home for me i read every word of every transcript of every mission all the conversations were recorded on tape between the air and the ground and between the astronauts when they were out of ground contact and reading those it really hits home what they were doing i found myself holding my breath and you know my shoulders were stiff ars so what s next i mean there s only about 100 million photos from the space shuttle era saunders thankfully they weren t all taken on film so if i wanted to complete space on film then what i haven t yet done is apollo soyuz skylab and the first whatever it is 20 percent of the shuttle so maybe that s next but i would just like a rest because i ve been doing this now since the middle of 2019 literally nonstop it s all i ve done with apollo and now mercury and gemini the books make a really nice set in that they re exactly the same size so it covers the first view of the curvature of earth and space right through to our last steps on the moon
when you turn off those spacecraft s radio receivers there s no way to turn them back on federal funding is about to run out for 19 active space missions studying earth s climate exploring the solar system and probing mysteries of the universe this year s budget expires at the end of this month and congress must act before october 1 to avert a government shutdown if congress passes a budget before then it will most likely be in the form of a continuing resolution an extension of this year s funding levels into the first few weeks or months of fiscal year 2026 the white house s budget request for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 25 percent cut to nasa s overall budget and a nearly 50 percent reduction in funding for the agency s science mission directorate these cuts would cut off money for at least 41 missions including 19 already in space and many more far along in development normally a president s budget request isn t the final say on matters lawmakers in the house and senate have written their own budget bills in the last several months there are differences between each appropriations bill but they broadly reject most of the trump administration s proposed cuts still this hasn t quelled the anxieties of anyone with a professional or layman s interest in space science the 19 active robotic missions chosen for cancellation are operating beyond their original design lifetime however in many cases they are in pursuit of scientific data that no other mission has a chance of collecting for decades or longer some of the mission names are recognizable to anyone with a passing interest in nasa s work they include the agency s two orbiting carbon observatory missions monitoring data signatures related to climate change the chandra x ray observatory which survived a budget scare last year and two of nasa s three active satellites orbiting mars and there s new horizons a spacecraft that made front page headlines in 2015 when it beamed home the first up close pictures of pluto another mission on the chopping block is juno the world s only spacecraft currently at jupiter both spacecraft have more to offer according to the scientists leading the missions new horizons is perfectly healthy said alan stern the mission s principal investigator at southwest research institute swri everything on the spacecraft is working all the spacecraft subsystems are performing perfectly as close to perfectly as one could ever hope and all the instruments are too the spacecraft has the fuel and power to run into the late 2040s or maybe 2050 new horizons is a decade and more than 2 5 billion miles 4 1 billion kilometers beyond pluto the probe flew by a frozen object named arrokoth on new year s day 2019 returning images of the most distant world ever explored by a spacecraft since then the mission has continued its speedy departure from the solar system and could become the third spacecraft to return data from interstellar space new horizons cost taxpayers 780 million from the start of development through the end of its primary mission after exploring pluto the project received 9 7 million from nasa to cover operations costs in 2024 the most recent year with full budget data it s unlikely new horizons will be able to make another close flyby of an object like it did with pluto and arrokoth but the science results keep rolling in just last year scientists announced the news that new horizons found the kuiper belt a vast outer zone of hundreds of thousands of small icy worlds beyond the orbit of neptune might extend much farther out than previously thought we re waiting for government in the form of congress the administration to come up with a funding bill for fy26 which will tell us if our mission is on the chopping block or not stern said the administration s proposal is to cancel essentially every extended mission so we re not being singled out but we would get caught in that stern who served as head of nasa s science division in 2007 and 2008 said the surest way to prevent the white house s cuts is for congress to pass a budget with specific instructions for the trump administration the administration ultimately will make some decision based on what congress does stern said if congress passes a continuing resolution then that opens a whole lot of other possibilities where the administration could do something without express direction from congress we re just going to have to see where we end up at the end of september and then in the fall stern said shutting down so many of nasa s science missions would be a tragic capitulation of us leadership and fiscally irresponsible we re pretty undeniably the frontrunner and have been for decades in space sciences stern said there s much more money in overruns than there is in what it costs to run these missions i mean dramatically and yet by cutting overruns you don t affect our leadership position turning off spacecraft would put us in third or fourth place depending on who you talk to behind the chinese and the europeans at least and maybe behind others stern resigned his job as nasa s science chief in 2008 after taking a similar stance arguing against cuts to healthy projects and research grants to cover overruns in other programs according to a report in science magazine juno meanwhile has been orbiting jupiter since 2016 collecting information on the giant planet s internal structure magnetic field and atmosphere everything is functional said scott bolton the lead scientist on juno also from swri there s been some degradation things that we saw many years ago but those haven t changed actually some of them improved to be honest the only caveat with juno is some radiation damage to its camera called junocam juno orbits jupiter once every 33 days and the trajectory brings the spacecraft through intense radiation belts trapped by the planet s powerful magnetic field juno s primary mission ended in 2021 and it s now operating in an extended mission approved through the end of this month the additional time exposed to harsh radiation is not surprisingly corrupting junocam s images in an interview with ars bolton suggested the radiation issue creates another opportunity for nasa to learn from the juno mission ground teams are attempting to repair the junocam imager through annealing a self healing process that involves heating the instrument s electronics and then allowing them to cool engineers sparingly tried annealing hardware space so juno s experience could be instructive for future missions even satellites at earth experience this radiation damage but there s very little done or known about it bolton said in fact what we re learning with juno has benefits for earth satellites both commercial and national security juno s passages through jupiter s harsh radiation belts provide a real world laboratory to experiment with annealing in space we can t really produce the natural radiation environment at earth or jupiter in a lab bolton said lessons learned from juno could soon be applied to nasa s next probe traveling to jupiter europa clipper launched last year and is on course to enter orbit around jupiter in 2030 when it will begin regular low altitude flybys of the planet s icy moon europa before clipper s launch engineers discovered a flaw that could make the spacecraft s transistors more susceptible to radiation damage nasa managers decided to proceed with the mission because they determined the damage could be repaired at jupiter with annealing so we have rationale to hopefully continue juno because of science national security and it sort of fits in the goals of exploration as well because you have high radiation even in these translunar orbits heading to the moon bolton said learning about how to deal with that and how to build spacecraft better to survive that and how to repair them is really an interesting twist that we came by on accident but nevertheless turns out to be really important it cost 28 4 million to operate juno in 2024 compared to nasa s 1 13 billion investment to build launch and fly the spacecraft to jupiter we re hoping everything s going to keep going bolton said we put in a proposal for three years the science is potentially very good but it s sort of unknown we just are waiting to hear and waiting for direction from nasa and we re watching all of the budget scenarios just like everybody else in the news nasa headquarters earlier this year asked stern and bolton along with teams leading other science missions coming under the ax for an outline of what it would take and what it would cost to close out their projects we sent something that was that was a sketch of what it might look like bolton said a closeout would be irreversible for at least some of the 19 missions at risk of termination termination doesn t just mean shutting down the contract and sending everybody away but it s also turning the spacecraft off stern said and when you turn off those spacecraft s radio receivers there s no way to turn them back on because they re off they can never get a command in so if we change our mind we ve had another election or had some congressional action anything like that it s really terminating the spacecraft and there s no going back
a battle is brewing over mrna vaccines which could intensify backlash against kennedy under ardent anti vaccine activist robert f kennedy jr federal health officials are working to link covid 19 mrna vaccines to the deaths of 25 children and may further restrict access to the shots possibly recommending them for people aged 75 and up instead of 65 and up according to the washington post four unnamed sources close to the situation told the post that trump administration health officials appear to be using information from the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers to make the claim that covid 19 vaccines have killed children vaers is a system in which anyone can report anything they think is an adverse event related to a vaccination the reports are completely unverified upon submission and the centers for disease control and prevention staff follow up on serious reports to try to substantiate claims and assess if they were actually caused by a vaccine they rarely are federal health experts continuously monitor vaers and other safety surveillance systems exhaustively assessing the safety of vaccines after billions of covid 19 doses have been administered worldwide they like other governments health organizations and academic researchers around the world have found the shots to be remarkably safe while they have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis inflammation of the heart and surrounding tissue respectively that risk is low and the cases are generally mild during the 2023 2024 covid 19 season the incidence rate of heart conditions was 27 cases per million doses for males aged 12 to 24 who have the highest risk of any group the shots have not been linked to deaths or heart transplants according to data presented by staff experts at the cdc generally among people of all ages death rates were lower for those vaccinated with mrna covid 19 vaccines than in the general population meanwhile 25 children died of covid 19 the disease not the vaccine since july 2023 of those 25 children 16 were old enough to get vaccinated but 14 had no record of getting a vaccine and none were up to date on their vaccines still kennedy has a long established disdain for the mrna vaccines in 2021 at the height of the pandemic kennedy petitioned the food and drug administration to revoke authorization of covid 19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future covid 19 vaccines he has since repeatedly spread false information about the vaccine including claiming without evidence that they have caused the death of children and are the deadliest vaccine s ever made in making those comments kennedy has pointed to vaers as his data source now that kennedy is secretary of the department of health and human services hhs he has continued his anti vaccine agenda and diligently installed allies in federal health agencies who share his anti vaccine anti science and anti public health views for instance last month kennedy canceled nearly 500 million in grants that supported developing mrna vaccines to prevent the next pandemic in june kennedy fired all 17 highly qualified and respected experts on a vaccine advisory panel for the cdc the advisory committee on immunization practices which sets the vaccine standards and insurance coverage for the country kennedy quickly restocked acip with hand selected members who share his contempt for mrna vaccines and pandemic policies he s currently considering adding more such members kennedy s acip is scheduled to meet next week september 18 and 19 to discuss covid 19 vaccines as well as the hepatitis b vaccine the measles mumps rubella varicella mmrv vaccine and respiratory syncytial virus rsv while the new members could vote to further restrict access to any of those safe lifesaving vaccines most of the focus has been on covid 19 vaccine access that access is currently in chaos due to new restrictions and a lack of updated acip recommendations which are usually made earlier in the year under kennedy the fda restricted access to the vaccines changing the product approvals from being available to everyone ages 6 months and up to now only being approved for those 65 and older and those under 64 who have a medical condition that puts them at a higher risk of covid 19 while some experts and health care providers had hoped that next week s acip meeting would add clarity to the situation and allow healthy adults and children better access to the shots the post s reporting suggests that s unlikely according to their sources kennedy s acip is considering recommending the vaccines to those 75 and older while instructing those 74 and younger to speak with their doctor about getting a shot another reported option is to not recommend the vaccine to people under the age of 75 at all unless they have a preexisting condition such additional restrictions would likely intensify the backlash against kennedy s anti vaccine agenda already medical organizations have taken the unprecedented action to release their own evidence based guidances that maintain covid 19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children particularly those under age 2 pregnant people and healthy adults many medical and health organizations as well as lawmakers and over 1 000 current and former hhs employees have also called for kennedy to resign criticism of kennedy s actions has spread across party lines sen bill cassidy r la a vaccine supporting physician who cast a critical vote for kennedy s confirmation had accused kennedy of denying people vaccines and called for next week s acip meeting to be postponed serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda membership and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced september acip meeting cassidy said these decisions directly impact children s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted if the meeting proceeds any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in cdc leadership meanwhile in a clear rebuff of kennedy s cancellation of mrna vaccine funding the republican led house committee on appropriations this week passed a 2026 spending bill that was specifically amended to inject the words including of mrna vaccines into a sentence about pandemic preparedness funding the bill now reads 1 100 000 000 to remain available through september 30 2027 shall be for expenses necessary to support advanced research and development including of mrna vaccines pursuant to section 319l of the phs act and other administrative expenses of the biomedical advanced research and development authority
unofficial mod lets classic nintendo gamecube title use ai chatbots with amusing results when software engineer joshua fonseca recently connected the gamecube simulation classic animal crossing to a modern ai language model like the kind that powers chatgpt he decided to shake things up by programming the ai to roleplay as villagers growing aware of their debt situation and giving them a shared memory to track conversations fonseca orchestrated a scenario where the residents began to organize against their raccoon landlord in animal crossing tom nook runs the town shop and provides home loans paid out in bells the in game currency that keep players perpetually in debt which is a core mechanic of the game predictably it escalated into an anti tom nook movement fonseca wrote in a detailed post documenting his hack that bridges a 2002 game to cloud based ai without modifying any game code while fonseca frames the uprising as a type of emergent phenomenon in his post and a youtube video examination of the source code by ai researcher simon willison shows that fonseca specifically instructed the villagers to behave this way and even escalate the unrest over time you are a resident of a town run by tom nook you are beginning to realize your mortgage is exploitative and the economy is unfair reads the initial prompt discuss this with the player and other villagers when appropriate even though fonseca stacked the deck so to speak it s still an interesting technical hack after connecting the simulated villagers to a real world newsfeed to provide context characters began relating headlines in casual conversation which the developer found surreal one villager named mitzi suddenly announced about the news european leaders are planning to meet with trump and zelenskyy another delivered a humorous simulation of self awareness oh my gosh josh i just had the weirdest dream like everything we do is a game arfer as amusing as this type of mod is it s worth remembering that large language models are always playing roles prompted by humans pulling statistically plausible outputs from training data that researchers fed into their neural networks when they created or later fine tuned them making this amusing amalgam of past and present technology possible required some clever engineering the technical feat fonseca pulled off involves a python script that monitors the game memory through the dolphin emulator sends dialogue context to ai models like gpt 5 or gemini and writes the responses back into the gamecube s ram the gamecube presented unique obstacles for this project with its 485 mhz powerpc processor 24mb of ram and no internet connectivity unless you add the modem or broadband adapter the console was fundamentally physically and philosophically designed to be an offline island fonseca notes his timing proved fortunate the animal crossing decompilation community had just finished reverse engineering the game s source code providing readable c instead of powerpc assembly this gave him access to the dialogue system s inner workings through a file called m message c he considered using the broadband adapter but it would have added many layers of additional complexity to the project rather than write an entire network stack for the gamecube from scratch fonseca implemented what he calls a memory mailbox this classic game modding technique uses specific ram addresses as communication channels his python script writes directly to gamecube memory through dolphin while the game reads from those same locations finding these addresses required what fonseca describes as becoming a memory archaeologist he wrote a custom scanner and spent hours in a loop talk to a villager freeze the emulator when dialogue appeared scan all 24 million bytes of ram for the text string then cross reference with different villagers he eventually located the speaker s name and dialogue buffer at specific addresses but discovering the addresses was only half the problem when you talk to a villager in animal crossing the game normally displays dialogue instantly calling an ai model over the internet takes several seconds willison examined the code and found fonseca s solution a watch dialogue function that polls memory 10 times per second when it detects a conversation starting it immediately writes placeholder text three dots with hidden pause commands between them followed by a press a to continue prompt so the user gets a press a to continue button and hopefully the llm has finished by the time they press that button willison noted in a hacker news comment while players watch dots appear and reach for the a button the mod races to get a response from the ai model and translate it into the game s dialog format simply writing text to memory froze the game animal crossing uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions a special prefix byte 0x7f signals commands rather than characters without the proper end of conversation control code the game waits forever think of it like html fonseca explains your browser doesn t just display words it interprets tags to make text bold the decompilation community had documented these codes allowing fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human readable format and the

meanwhile congress is trying to keep serious scientists from weighing in while the trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the us the lone exception has been a draft department of energy report prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change the shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it required over 450 pages to detail all of its shortcomings but its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels now in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit the department of energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report making the lawsuit moot meanwhile congress is also attempting to muddy the waters in response to the doe report the national academies of science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science republicans on the house committee on oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the national academies for undermining the epa as we noted in our original coverage the members of the advisory group that prepared the doe report were carefully chosen for having views that are well outside the mainstream of climate science based on their past public statements they could be counted on to produce a report that would question the severity of climate change and raise doubts about whether we had any evidence it was happening the report they produced went beyond that by suggesting that the net effect of our carbon emissions was likely to be a positive for humanity not only was that shoddy science but a lawsuit filed by the environmental defense fund and the union of concerned scientists suggested that it was likely illegal groups like the one that wrote the report the suit alleges fall under the federal advisory committee act which among other things dictates that these groups must be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented rather than be selected in order to reinforce a single point of view the among other things that the law dictates is that the advisory groups have public meetings that are announced in advance be chartered with a well defined mission and all of their records be made available to the public in contrast nobody within the department of energy including the contrarians who wrote the report acknowledged the work they were doing publicly until the day the draft report was released the suit alleges that the work of this group fell under the federal advisory committee act and the group violated the act in all of the above ways and more the act asks the courts to force the doe to disclose all the relevant records involved with the preparation of the report and to cease relying on it for any regulatory actions that s significant because the environmental protection agency cited it in its attempts to roll back its prior finding that greenhouse gases posed a danger to the us public this week the doe responded in court by claiming the panel that produced the report had been dissolved making the suit moot that does not address the fact that the epa is continuing to rely on the report in its attempts to argue there s no point in regulating greenhouse gases it also leaves the report itself in a weird limbo its release marked the start of a period of public comment and said comments were supposed to be considered during the revisions that would take place before the draft was finalized failure to complete the revision process would leave the epa vulnerable to claims that it s relying on an incomplete draft report for its scientific justifications so while the doe s tactics may protect some of its internal documents it may ultimately cause larger problems for the trump administration s agenda earlier this year we were critical of the us s national academies of science for seemingly refusing to respond to the trump administration s attacks on science that reticence appeared to end in august with the release of the doe climate report and the announcement that the epa was using that report as the latest word on climate science which it argued had changed considerably since the initial epa decisions on this issue in 2009 in response the national academies announced that it would fast track a new analysis of the risks posed by greenhouse gases this one done by mainstream scientists instead of a handful of fringe figures the goal was to get it done before the epa closed its public comment period on its proposal to ignore greenhouse gases obviously this poses a threat to the epa s planned actions which apparently prompted republicans in congress to step in earlier this month the chair of the house committee on oversight and government reform rep james comer r ky announced he was investigating the national academies for preparing this report calling it a blatant partisan act to undermine the trump administration comer has also sent a letter to the national academies outlining his concerns and demanding a variety of documents some of these are pretty convoluted the study is led by a national academies member who serves as an external advisor to the science philanthropy alliance which has ties to the left wing group arabella advisors through the new venture fund an organization that promotes a variety of progressive causes and funds major climate litigation comer says suggesting it s not entirely clear what another member of the study panel had the audacity to endorse former president biden for his climate policies separately comer says he s concerned about the source of the funds that will pay for this study some of comer s demands are consistent with this focusing on funding for this review but he goes well beyond that demanding a list of all the national academies sources of funding as well as any internal communications about this study he s also going on a bit of a witch hunt within the federal government demanding any communications the nas has had with government employees regarding the doe s report or the epa s greenhouse gas decisions it s pretty clear that comer recognizes that any unbiased presentation of climate science is going to undercut the epa s rationale for reversing course on greenhouse gas regulations so he s preparing in advance to undercut that presentation by claiming it s rife with conflicts of interest and he s willing to include supporting politicians who want to act on climate change as a conflict all of this maneuvering is taking place before the epa has even finalized its planned u turn on greenhouse gases a step that will undoubtedly trigger additional investigations and lawsuits in many ways this is likely to reflect many of these parties laying the groundwork for the legal fight to come and while some of this is ostensibly about the state of the science that has supported the epa s past policy decisions it s clear that the administration and its supporters are doing their best to minimize science s impact on their preferred course of action
we did not evolve to handle this utah governor says the conservative broadcaster provocateur charlie kirk murdered this week during a visit to a utah college had tweeted some life advice this summer when things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds it s important to stay grounded turn off your phone read scripture spend time with friends and remember internet fury is not real life it s going to be ok kirk was not himself always a great role model for staying grounded thoughtful or caring to others he was better known for look at me stunts like offering completely unsolicited commentary upon taylor swift s engagement calling the singer a cat lady and telling her to engage in reality more to reject feminism and to submit to your husband because you re not in charge but his advice itself isn t all bad social media so often feeds most hungrily upon our darker emotions constant reinforcement of anger fear frustration and even jealously fomo anyone cannot possibly be good for us to marinate in so often maintaining a connection to the physical world and the physical presence of others can be immensely stabilizing sometimes even helpfully boring after we become too addicted to the rush of emotions caused by one more internet outrage kirk was wrong about two things in that tweet though first internet fury is quite clearly real life and two things may not be ok even after you set down the phone and are sitting beneath a tent in utah talking to students authorities announced today that after several incorrect detentions they are reasonably certain they have arrested kirk s shooter spencer cox the governor of utah said at a press conference that the shooter s bullets were covered with various bits of graffiti including notices bulge owo what s this online meme involving furries hey fascist catch oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao if you read this you are gay lmao there was also a series of markings described as up arrow right arrow and three down arrow symbols the new york times described these as a possible reference to a sequence of controller moves that unleashes bombs in the popular video game helldivers 2 this is an extremely online style of writing cryptic meme driven and jokey even about serious or disturbing issues was the alleged shooter helped toward his act of violence by the communities he was in online and are millions of internet users helping or hurting their own moral and civic identities by watching detailed video of the murder which was immediately shared on social media as his press conference wrapped up cox made a plea for everyone to follow kirk s tweeted advice which he cited he said that we are not wired as human beings biologically historically we have not evolved in a way that we are capable of processing those types of violent imagery this is not good for us it is not good to consume and he added that social media is a cancer on our society right now i would encourage people to log off turn off touch grass hug a family member go out and do good in your community this could have been useful to extremely online people like the alleged shooter who was turned in by some of his own family members and who might have been dissuaded from his actions had he engaged more directly with them of course simplistic advice like this is often wrong difficult family members and broken relationships might mean that in person connection is also unhelpful for some it might also be good advice for the kinds of extremely online people who lead the country by posting social media threats to unleash the department of war upon chicago shown burning in the background at its heart though cox raises a question about whether social media is 1 a powerful force capable of both great good and terrible incitement and misinformation or whether it is 2 a mere cancer i assume ars readers are divided on this question given that the ars staff itself has differing views one can point of course to the successes the powerless can call out the lies of the powerful they can gin up color revolutions to topple dictators and they can publish their views with an ease and at a cost that not even the printing press itself an extremely disruptive technology could manage on the flip side of course is all the cancer the floods of misinformation and bile the yelling the cancel culture the virtue signaling the scams and hoaxes the ethnic nationalism the casual sharing of both gore and pornography the buffoonish natures of the tech overlords who run too many of these services and that feeling you get when you log in to facebook and realize with a shock that your aunt is a closet racist the question for me a live question one i m not sure i can answer is whether all these negative effects will eventually be regulated or suppressed once we acquire more familiarity with the technology or whether the fundamentally addictive design of social media apps will pose an insoluble challenge to human willpower and flourishing or maybe we put too much blame on addictive tech when in reality humans fundamentally pine for spectacle outrage cruelty and a sense of community formed by excluding others social media in this view may be more of a diagnostic tool for our condition than a cause of it or perhaps the answer is all of the above can we save the virtues and limit the vices of social media by imposing screen time limits avoiding the most toxic communities and blocking the many online charlatans and fools are there lessons we can learn from the general success of the ars comments which have been on the whole a productive and highly moderated enterprise among a specific community should we seek to return to smaller and more moderated groups rather than the current global free for all of social media should we demand that social media apps have more moderation and if so do we want to keep this moderation neutral or let it be more explicitly political what will we gain by raising the gates against certain kinds of posts and posters and what will we lose or is it time as cox s metaphor actually suggests to treat social media as something irredeemable and to reach for the chemotherapy the radiation and the surgeon s scalpel
north america has bought 1 3 million evs this year china has bought 7 6 million here s some good news for a friday afternoon for 2025 through august global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024 according to the analysts at rho motion that amounts to 12 5 million evs although the data combines both battery evs and plug in hybrid evs for the total however that s for global sales in fact ev adoption is moving even faster in europe which has grown by 31 percent so far this year rho says that bev sales grew by 31 percent but phev sales by just 30 percent a total of 2 6 million plug in vehicles in some european countries the increase has been even more impressive up by 45 percent in germany 41 percent in italy and by 100 percent in spain but despite a number of interesting new evs from renault and the various stellantis owned french automakers ev sales in france are down by 6 percent so far year on year tesla has seen none of this sales growth in europe however as we noted last month this region s tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in july china had bought an additional 7 6 million new evs between january and august of this year although this growth slowed in july and august partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to chinese government policies and as also noted last month byd recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900 000 vehicles down to 4 6 million for this year meanwhile here in north america things aren t quite so hot ev sales are still growing but barely up just 6 percent between january and august 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024 august was actually a good month for ev sales in the us as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the irs 30d tax credit for clean vehicles which disappears at the end of september that s a result of anti ev policies put in place by president trump and republicans in congress and it s far from the only one other tax credits intended to foster ev adoption by businesses are also being eradicated the environmental protection agency is no longer fining automakers for failing to meet fleet averages and the trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure global ev sales have now reached 12 5 million units in the opening eight months of the year said rho motion data manager charles lester the north american market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the us accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of september momentum remains in europe underpinned by the emissions legislation with major automotive countries germany and the uk growing by 45 percent and 31 percent year to date respectively year on year growth in the chinese market slowed in july august 2025 however this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade in scheme increased last year which spurred on ev demand in the country lester said
bill author says law gives this industry an opportunity to treat people fairly california s legislature this week approved a bill to let renters opt out of bulk billing arrangements that force them to pay for internet service from a specific provider the bill says that by january 1 a landlord must allow the tenant to opt out of paying for any subscription from a third party internet service provider such as through a bulk billing arrangement to provide service for wired internet cellular or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy if a landlord fails to do so the tenant may deduct the cost of the subscription to the third party internet service provider from the rent and the landlord would be prohibited from retaliating the bill passed the state senate in a 30 7 vote on wednesday but needs gov gavin newsom s signature to become law it was approved by the state assembly in a 75 0 vote in april assemblymember rhodesia ransom a democratic lawmaker who authored the bill told ars today that lobby groups for internet providers and real estate companies have been working really hard to defeat it but she expects newsom will approve i strongly believe that the governor is going to look at what this bill provides as far as protections for tenants and sign it into law ransom said in a phone interview ransom disputed claims from lobby groups that bulk billing reduces internet prices for tenants this is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly it s not super restrictive we are not banning bulk billing we re not even limiting how much money the people can make what we re saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement they should be allowed to opt out she said a stricter bill could have told landlords that you can t charge the customer more than you re paying we could have put a cap on the amount that you re able to charge she said there s so many other things that we could have done that would ve been a lot less business friendly but the goal was not to harm business the goal was to help people in theory bulk billing could reduce prices for tenants if discounts negotiated between landlords and internet providers were passed on to renters but ransom said where there would be an opportunity for these huge discounts to be passed on to tenants it s not happening we know of thousands of tenants across the state who are in landlord tenant agreements where the landlord is actually adding an additional bonus for themselves pocketing change and not passing the discount on to the tenants once we started working on this bill we started to hear more and more about places where people were stuck in these agreements and their landlords were not letting them out ransom said not all landlords do this and that it is generally the large corporate landlords who own hundreds or thousands of properties that were the ones who were reluctant to let their tenants out california s action comes about eight months after the federal communications commission abandoned a proposal to give tenants the right to opt out of bulk billing for internet service the potential federal action was proposed in march 2024 by then fcc chairwoman jessica rosenworcel but nixed in january 2025 by chairman brendan carr bulk billing contracts are only banned by the fcc when they give a provider the exclusive right to access and serve a building despite that restriction a bulk billing deal between an isp and landlord can make it less financially feasible for other providers to serve a multi unit building letting people opt out of bulk billing arrangements makes serving a building at least slightly more viable for a competing provider ransom said the fcc action was very unfortunate and give s a disadvantage to people who are already at the mercy of landlords the california bill was not welcomed by lobby groups for internet providers and landlords the california broadband video association which represents cable companies paid for a sponsored commentary in several news publications to express its opposition ab 1414 is an anti affordability bill masked as consumer protection and it will only serve to widen the digital divide in california wrote the lobby group s ceo janus norman norman complained that property owners would have to provide a refund to tenants who decline the internet service provided through the building s contract with a specific internet service provider he argued that without bulk billing low income families and tenants risk losing access altogether letting tenants opt out of bulk deals undermines the basis of the cost savings and will lead to bulk billing being phased out norman wrote this will result in higher bills for everyone including those already struggling he claimed the truth very simply is this bulk billing is good for consumers the cable industry commentary said taking away bulk discounts raises total housing costs when californians can least afford it the bill also drew opposition from the real estate technology transformation center rettc the group s sponsors include real estate companies and internet providers at t comcast and cox another notable sponsor of rettc is realpage which has faced claims from the us government and state attorneys general that its software distorts competition in rental housing by helping landlords collectively set prices ab 1414 introduces an opt out requirement that would fundamentally undermine the economics of bulk billing the rettc said by fragmenting service it could destabilize networks and reduce the benefits residents and operators rely on today the group claimed the bill could lead to higher broadband costs for renters reduced isp investment in multifamily housing disruption of property wide smart technology and widening of the digital divide in california the rettc said it joined with the national apartment association and the california rental housing association to detail the groups concerns directly to the bill sponsors the california broadband video association seems to be worried about wireless providers serving buildings wired up with cable the group s commentary claimed that the bill s lack of technology neutrality also creates winners and losers granting certain types of providers an unfair advantage over their competitors ransom said her bill may be especially helpful for wireless or satellite providers because they wouldn t need to install wires in each building this does help with market competition and in fact some of our support came from some of the smaller internet service providers and because this bill is technology neutral it helps with not only the current technology but any new technology that comes out she said while ransom s bill could help make broadband more affordable for renters california lawmakers recently abandoned a more aggressive effort to require affordable broadband plans assemblymember tasha boerner proposed a state law that would force internet service providers to offer 15 monthly plans to people with low incomes but tabled the bill after the trump administration threatened to block funding for expanding broadband networks
experts find fake sources in canadian government report that took 18 months to complete on friday cbc news reported that a major education reform document prepared for the canadian province of newfoundland and labrador contains at least 15 fabricated citations that academics suspect were generated by an ai language model despite the same report calling for ethical ai use in schools a vision for the future transforming and modernizing education released august 28 serves as a 10 year roadmap for modernizing the province s public schools and post secondary institutions the 418 page document took 18 months to complete and was unveiled by co chairs anne burke and karen goodnough both professors at memorial university s faculty of education alongside education minister bernard davis one of the fake citations references a 2008 national film board movie called schoolyard games that does not exist according to a board spokesperson the exact citation reportedly appears in a university of victoria style guide a document that teaches students how to format references using fictional examples the style guide warns on its first page that many citations in this guide are fictitious meaning they are made up examples used only to demonstrate proper formatting yet someone or some ai chatbot copied the fake example directly into the education accord report as if it were a real source aaron tucker a memorial assistant professor whose research focuses on ai history in canada told cbc he could not find numerous sources cited in the report despite searching the mun library other academic databases and google the fabrication of sources at least begs the question did this come from generative ai tucker told cbc whether that s ai i don t know but fabricating sources is a telltale sign of artificial intelligence since the inception of ai language models generating fabricated citations has been a continuous problem the tendency to confabulate academic citations often causes particular trouble in academic and legal contexts where fabricated sources can easily slip past lazy human review because they appear properly formatted and contextually appropriate ai language models like the kind that power chatgpt gemini and claude excel at producing exactly this kind of believable fiction because they first and foremost produce plausible outputs not accurate ones they always generate a statistical approximation based on patterns absorbed during training when those patterns don t align well with reality the result is confident sounding misinformation even ai models that can search the web for real sources can potentially fabricate citations choose the wrong ones or mischaracterize them errors happen made up citations are a totally different thing where you essentially demolish the trustworthiness of the material josh lepawsky the former president of the memorial university faculty association who resigned from the report s advisory board in january told cbc citing a deeply flawed process the presence of potentially ai generated fake citations becomes especially awkward given that one of the report s 110 recommendations specifically states the provincial government should provide learners and educators with essential ai knowledge including ethics data privacy and responsible technology use sarah martin a memorial political science professor who spent days reviewing the document discovered multiple fabricated citations around the references i cannot find i can t imagine another explanation she told cbc you re like this has to be right this can t not be this is a citation in a very important document for educational policy when contacted by cbc co chair karen goodnough declined an interview request writing in an email we are investigating and checking references so i cannot respond to this at the moment the department of education and early childhood development acknowledged awareness of a small number of potential errors in citations in a statement to cbc from spokesperson lynn robinson we understand that these issues are being addressed and that the online report will be updated in the coming days to rectify any errors

engineered pathway lets carbon be plugged directly into key metabolic pathways lots of people are excited about the idea of using plants to help us draw down some of the excess carbon dioxide we ve been pumping into the atmosphere it would be nice to think that we could reforest our way out of the mess we re creating but recent studies have indicated there s simply not enough productive land for this to work out one alternative might be to get plants to take up carbon dioxide more efficiently unfortunately the enzyme that incorporates carbon dioxide into photosynthesis called rubisco is remarkably inefficient so a team of researchers in taiwan decided to try something new literally they put together a set of enzymes that added a new to nature biochemical cycle to plants that let it incorporate carbon far more efficiently the resulting plants grew larger and incorporated more carbon in the abstract incorporating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the biochemistry of the cell seems simple you just link up a few of the carbon atoms and you re off but in reality it s fiendishly complicated carbon dioxide is an extremely stable molecule so incorporating it requires a very energetically favorable reaction in the calvin cycle of photosynthesis that reaction involves linking the carbon dioxide as part of a reaction that breaks apart a modified five carbon sugar creating two three carbon molecules some of those molecules get fed into the cell s metabolism while others get built up into a five carbon sugar again restarting the cycle it works but again the central enzyme that incorporates the co 2 is inefficient and as the researchers behind the new work note in a paper describing it the three carbon molecules it produces aren t a great match for all of the cell s metabolism the lipids used to make fats and the cell membrane are built up two carbons at a time for that to work plant cells actually oxidize a carbon back off releasing carbon dioxide in order to create a two carbon source for building lipids for those of you who remember basic biochemistry lipids are built using a molecule called acetyl co a which has a two carbon acetyl group attached to a larger molecule the co a that can easily be lopped off to combine the two carbons with other molecules so the team was interested in establishing something similar to the calvin cycle but capable of outputting a two carbon molecule without re emitting the carbon dioxide molecule that had just been captured what they came up with is the malyl coa glycerate cycle which they fortunately abbreviated as the mcg cycle so nobody would ever have to remember its real name the reactions of the cycle there are eight of them are all catalyzed by existing enzymes though those enzymes come from a number of different species so they don t naturally occur together credit yu et al the mcg cycle has a few very useful features it spits out a two carbon product at one of the steps which can be directly used in the production of lipids it also builds that molecule by incorporating carbon atoms at two different steps in the cycle meaning a single cycle captures more carbon than gets taken up during the calvin cycle in photosynthesis one of these is technically a bicarbonate molecule which is produced when carbon dioxide dissolves in water finally there is a point in the mcg cycle where it can exchange molecules with the calvin cycle allowing those two systems to interact and draw off any excess materials produced by either of them in 2018 the same lab tested the mcg cycle in photosynthetic bacteria in their new paper they describe inserting all the genes into a plant cell and seeing how the plant responded for testing purposes they used a small weed named arabidopsis that is a mainstay of plant research and well it worked remarkably well the plants carrying all the genes for the mcg cycle weighed two to three times as much as control plants that only had some of the genes they had more leaves the leaves themselves were larger and the plants produced more seeds in a variety of growing conditions the plants with an intact mcg cycle incorporated more carbon and they did so without increasing their water uptake having a two carbon output also worked as expected by feeding the plants radioactive bicarbonate they were able to trace the carbon showing up in the expected molecules and imaging confirmed that the plants were making so many lipids that their cells formed internal pockets containing nothing but fatty materials triglyceride levels increased by factors of 100 or more so by a variety of measures the plants actually did better with an extra pathway for fixing carbon there are a number of cautions though for starters it s not clear whether what we re learning using a small weed will also apply to larger plants or crops or really anything much beyond arabidopsis at the moment it could be that having excess globs of fat floating around the cell has consequences for something like a tree plants grown in a lab also tend to be provided with a nutrient rich soil and it s not clear whether all of this would apply to a range of real world conditions finally we can t say whether all the excess carbon these plants are sucking in from the atmosphere would end up being sequestered in any useful sense it could be that all the fat would just get oxidized as soon as the plant dies that said there are a lot of approaches to making biofuel that rely on modifying the fats found in plants or algae it s possible that this can eventually help make biofuels efficient so they actually have a net positive effect on the climate regardless of practical impacts however it s pretty amazing that we ve now reached the point where we can fundamentally rewire a bit of metabolism that has been in operation for billions of years without completely messing up plants science 2025 doi 10 1126 science adp3528 about dois
smaller on the outside bigger on the inside and it goes farther on a single charge san diego the original nissan leaf was a car with a mission long before elon musk set his sights on tesla selling vast numbers of electric vehicles to the masses then nissan ceo carlos ghosn wanted nissan to shift half a million leafs a year in the early 2010s that didn t quite come to pass but by 2020 it had sold its 500 000th ev which went from its factory in sunderland england to a customer in norway pioneering though they were both first and second generation leafs were compromised they were adapted from existing internal combustion engine platforms with the electric powertrains shoehorned inside the cars real handicaps were a lack of liquid cooling for the battery packs like an older porsche 911 the leaf was air cooled albeit with none of the collector value that s all changed for generation three the new leaf is built on a dedicated ev platform shared with nissan s alliance partners renault and mitsubishi and which we have previously seen used to good effect in the nissan ariya the benefits of using a platform purpose designed for electric propulsion are obvious from the space efficiency the new car is 3 inches 75 mm shorter from the outside but offers nearly 9 inches 221 mm more rear leg room yes really making it a much more suitable place to put adults although the new leaf is 0 8 inches 20 mm wider it s a few mm shorter and has a lower drag coefficient cd 0 26 so the overall effect is a more efficient shape the nose bears a family resemblance to the ariya and the body style is sort of a crossover sort of a fastback sedan depending on your frame of reference here and there you ll notice iconography that calls out the automaker s name two vertical stripes ni in japanese then three horizontal ones san in japanese i m told that if you look there are some ginkgo leaves as easter eggs hidden in the design but i did not find them during our hours with the car for now there s one powertrain option a 214 hp 160 kw 262 lb ft 355 nm motor packaged together with its inventor and reducer powered by a 75 kwh net lithium ion battery pack the battery pack is integrated into the car s thermal management system which also loops in the chiller the motor and the hvac system it can fast charge at up to 150 kw via the nacs port built into its left side or using a ccs1 adapter here and should charge from 10 80 percent in 35 minutes on the driver s side is a j1772 port for ac charging that can also work bidirectionally to send up to 1 5 kw of ac power to an external device via an adapter nissan said it kept the j1772 port because it expects to sell the new leaf to a lot of legacy customers who already have their own home charger and it wanted to minimize the number of adapters necessary how far it goes on a single charge depends on which trim level you re in nissan brought some preproduction leaf platinum models to the first drive these are very highly equipped with an electrochromic dimming roof the led head and taillights you see in the images a couple of ac outlets inside the car with the ability to power up to 3 4 kw across two outlets and a better sound system but it also comes on 19 inch alloy wheels and as we all know bigger wheels mean smaller range indeed the leaf platinum has a range of 259 miles 417 km on a single charge the 34 230 sv loses the panoramic roof and the interior v2l outlets and you ll have to manually open and close the tailgate at the back and the alloy wheels are an inch smaller which increases the range to 288 miles 464 km but it keeps the heated front seats and the twin 14 3 inch displays one for your instruments one for infotainment with google built in for the platinum and sv that means onboard google maps with a route planner that will take into account your state of charge and which can precondition the battery if it knows your destination is a fast charger nissan is only including the google connected services for the first year though after that owners will have to pay a monthly fee although nissan wasn t able to tell us how much that is conveniently both wireless android auto and apple carplay are included and will continue to work after the year s trial and you can manually precondition the battery for charging but automatic preconditioning via the infotainment system will not work without an active subscription the sv and platinum can also be optioned with a heat pump 300 but the 29 990 s cannot and it lacks the twin displays of the car you see in the images which means no automatic battery preconditioning although like the more expensive trims it does still have wireless apple carplay and android auto you also get 18 inch steel wheels with aero hubcaps and a range of 303 miles 487 km on a single charge see what i mean about wheel size and range i d very much like to spend some time in an s and an sv if only to see what difference a larger tire sidewall makes to the ride comfort on 19 inch wheels the ride was firm and translated bumps and divots through the suspension and into the cabin there wasn t much body roll but your progress will be limited by the grip available to the low rolling resistance tires push too hard and the result is plenty of understeer but this is not a push too hard kind of ev with just 214 hp it accelerates quickly enough to get out of its own way but it s telling that nissan did not share a 0 60 mph time during the briefing if i had to guess i d say between 5 6 seconds which used to be considered very rapid it has four drive modes eco normal sport and personal with three different throttle maps and two steering weights to choose from and there are now four levels of lift off regenerative braking which you toggle on with the left steering wheel paddle and off with the right paddle you can t turn regen completely off so like general motors family of evs the leaf will not really coast and loses a few mph even on downhill stretches as it converts some kinetic energy to electrical energy there s also an e step button on the dash which turns on maximum regen braking and may add some friction braking to the mix unlike using the paddles this setting should remain on the next time you start the car but neither of the full regen settings is able to bring the car to a complete stop we were told that the feature is viewed with suspicion in some markets including japan and like pop out door handles it appears that china is in the process of banning one pedal driving entirely both e step and max regen work very well in traffic or on a twisty road where they simulate engine braking but given the choice i would use the paddles to control regen braking that s because like the mercedes eq family of evs in this mode the brake pedal moves toward the firewall as the car slows the engineer s excuse for this is that the pedal moves by the same distance it would have moved had the driver used it to slow the car by the amount it has just slowed but my rebuttal is that the brake pedal should always be where i expect to find it in an emergency and if that s an inch farther away that s not cool that s really a minor gripe though no one says you have to push the e step switch on the dash slightly more annoying but only slightly is the wind noise from the sideview mirrors which is noticeable even at 45 mph 72 km h although easily drowned out if you re listening to something on the audio system for a daily driver the third generation leaf is rather compelling especially the s although the lack of heated front seats in that model might be too much of a deal breaker considering how important seat heaters are to ev efficiency in winter because it s more efficient to heat the driver than warm all the air in the car the sv is more likely to be the sweet spot this trim level can have the seabreeze paint you see here or a white pearl which are alternatives to the four shades available to the s the hyundai kona ev and kia niro ev are probably the leaf s two closest rivals both of which are compelling cars and the forthcoming kia ev3 will probably also be cross shopped all of which is good news if you re looking for a smaller affordable electric car
man agreed to return more than 1 000 stolen dvds to his former employer a former employee of a multinational dvd company was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing hundreds of pre release dvds and blu rays and leaking blockbuster movies online the department of justice confirmed thursday back in may steven hale pleaded guilty to spending about a year between 2021 and 2022 stealing discs from his employer and selling them online through e commerce sites among movies that hale uploaded for illegal download were highly anticipated titles like dune as well as sequels to popular films like f9 the fast saga and venom let there be carnage but according to the doj hale did the most damage by leaking advance copies of spider man no way home that particular movie released exclusively in theaters in 2021 became the first movie after the covid pandemic started to gross 1 billion at the box office likely dvd sales were expected to be just as explosive but for many fans too cautious to return to movie theaters at the time dvd leaks became too enticing to pass up hale wasn t the only one to recognize the high demand online with illegal downloads of the movie becoming so widespread that reasonlabs reported that scammers started planting malware in illegal copies of the movie to lure in as many victims as possible it was in this climate that hale bypassed drm encryption which prevents copying to rip that movie from the blu ray disc selling the high quality leak online amidst a sea of inferior bootlegs more than a month before fans could access it legally unsurprisingly that dvd rip alone was downloaded tens of millions of times with an estimated loss to the copyright owner of tens of millions of dollars the doj said hale a 38 year old with prior felony convictions for armed robbery risked a potential sentence of 15 years for these crimes but he reduced his sentence to a maximum of five years through his plea deal at the time the doj credited him for taking responsibility arguing that he deserved a maximum reduction partly because the total infringement amount was likely no more than 40 000 not the tens of millions the doj claimed in today s release ultimately hale pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement while agreeing to pay restitution the exact amount is not clarified in the release and return approximately 1 160 stolen dvds and blu rays that the cops seized to his former employer hale also pleaded guilty to being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm the doj noted after cops uncovered that he unlawfully possessed a pistol that was loaded with one live round in the chamber and 13 rounds in the magazine combining the dvd theft and firearm charges the us district court in tennessee sentenced hale to 57 months just short of the five year maximum sentence he could have faced in the doj s press release acting assistant attorney general matthew r galeotti claimed the win while warning that today s sentencing signals our commitment to protecting american innovation from pirates that would exploit others work for a quick profit which in this case cost one copyright owner tens of millions of dollars

falcon 9 launches first satellites in a military megaconstellation the first 21 satellites in a constellation that could become a cornerstone for the pentagon s golden dome missile defense shield were successfully launched from california on wednesday aboard a spacex falcon 9 rocket ars reports the falcon 9 took off from vandenberg space force base california and headed south over the pacific ocean reaching an orbit over the poles before releasing the 21 military owned satellites to begin several weeks of activations and checkouts first of many these 21 satellites will boost themselves to a final orbit at an altitude of roughly 600 miles 1 000 kilometers the pentagon plans to launch 133 more satellites over the next nine months to complete the build out of the space development agency s first generation or tranche 1 constellation of missile tracking and data relay satellites military officials have worked for six years to reach this moment the space development agency sda was established during the first trump administration which made plans for an initial set of demonstration satellites that launched a couple of years ago in 2022 the pentagon awarded contracts for the first 154 operational spacecraft including the ones launched wednesday back in 2019 when the sda was stood up it was to do two things one was to make sure that we can do beyond line of sight targeting and the other was to pace the threat the emerging threat in the missile warning and missile tracking domain that s what the focus has been said gurpartap gp sandhoo the sda s acting director another falcon 9 was delayed three times spacex scrubbed launching a communications satellite from an indonesian company for a third consecutive day on wednesday spaceflight now reports possible technical issues got in the way of a launch attempt after back to back days of weather delays at cape canaveral space force station florida the falcon 9 finally launched thursday evening with the boeing built nusantara lima communications satellite targeting a geosynchronous transfer orbit it s the latest satellite from the indonesian company pasifik satelit nusantara a declining market this was just the fifth geosynchronous communications satellite to launch on a commercial rocket this year all by spacex there were 21 such satellites that launched on commercial vehicles in 2015 including spacex s falcon 9 europe s ariane 5 russia s proton ula s atlas v and japan s h iia much of the world s launch capacity today is used to deploy smaller communications satellites into low earth orbit primarily for broadband connectivity rather than for the video broadcast market once dominated by higher altitude geosynchronous satellites putin urges russia to build more rocket engines russian president vladimir putin urged aerospace industry leaders on september 5 to press on with efforts to develop booster rocket engines for space launch vehicles and build on russia s longstanding reputation as a leader in space technology reuters reports putin who spent the preceding days in china and the russian far eastern port of vladivostok flew to the southern russian city of samara where he met industry specialists and toured the kuznetsov design bureau engine manufacturing plant a shell of its former self it is important to consistently renew production capacity in terms of engines for booster rockets russian news agencies quoted putin as saying during the visit and in doing so we must not only meet our own current and future needs but also move actively on world markets and be successful competitors the kuznetsov plant in samara builds medium class rd 107 and rd 108 engines for russia s soyuz 2 rockets which launch russian military satellites and crew and cargo to the international space station their designs can be traced to the dawn of the space age nearly 70 years ago meanwhile the outlook for heavier duty russian rocket engines is murky at best russia s most flown large rocket engine in the post cold war era the rd 180 produced by a company called energomash is out of production after the end of sales to the united states india nabs a noteworthy launch contract astroscale a satellite servicing and space debris mitigation company based in japan has selected india s polar satellite launch vehicle pslv to deliver a small satellite named issa j1 to orbit in 2027 this is an interesting mission the issa j1 spacecraft will fly up to two large pieces of satellite debris in orbit to image and inspect them issa j1 developed in partnership with the japanese government is one in a series of astroscale missions testing different ways of approaching monitoring capturing and refueling other objects in space the launch agreement was signed between astroscale and newspace india limited the commercial arm of india s space agency rideshare not an option we selected nsil after thorough evaluations of more than 10 launch service providers over the past year considering technical capabilities track record cost and other elements said eddie kato president and managing director of astroscale japan india s pslv is right sized for a mission like this issa j1 is a rarity in that it must launch on a dedicated rocket because it has to reach a specific orbit to line up with the pieces of space debris it will approach and inspect rideshare launches such as those that routinely fly on spacex s falcon 9 rocket are cheaper but go to standard orbits popular for many different types of satellite missions a dedicated launch on a falcon 9 would presumably have been more expensive than a flight on india s smaller pslv rocket lab s electron another rocket popular for dedicated launches of small satellites lacks the performance required for astroscale s mission russian cargo en route to iss another cargo ship is flying to humanity s orbital outpost with the successful launch of russia s progress ms 32 supply freighter on thursday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan nasaspaceflight com reports the supply ship launched aboard a soyuz 2 1a rocket and arrived in orbit about nine minutes later kicking off a two day pursuit of the international space station this was the 300th launch of an assembly crew or cargo mission to the iss since 1998 including a handful of missions that didn t reach the complex due to rocket or spacecraft failures important stuff the progress ms 32 cargo craft will dock with the aft port of the space station s russian zvezda service module on saturday the payloads flying on the progress mission include food experiments clothing water air and propellant to be pumped into the space station s onboard tanks the spacecraft will also reboost the lab s orbit metallic tiles not so great it has been two weeks since spacex s last starship test flight and engineers have diagnosed issues with its heat shield identified improvements and developed a preliminary plan for the next time the ship heads into space ars reports bill gerstenmaier a spacex executive in charge of build and flight reliability presented the findings monday at the american astronautical society s glenn space technology symposium in cleveland the test flight went extremely well gerstenmaier said but he noted some important lessons learned with the ship s heat shield crunch wrap reigns supreme we were essentially doing a test to see if we could get by with non ceramic tiles so we put three metal tiles on the side of the ship to see if they would provide adequate heat control because they would be simpler to manufacture and more durable than the ceramic tiles it turns out they re not gerstenmaier said the metal tiles didn t work so well one bright spot with the heat shield was the performance of a new experimental material around and under the tiles we call it crunch wrap gerstenmaier said it s like a wrapping paper that goes around each tile on the next starship flight spacex will likely cover more parts of the heat shield with this crunch wrap material gerstenmaier said the inaugural flight of starship version 3 with upgraded engines and more fuel is now set to occur next year an sls compromise might be afoot in dc the trump administration is seeking to cancel nasa s space launch system rocket after two more flights but key lawmakers in congress including republican sen ted cruz of texas aren t ready to go along so is this an impasse possibly not as sources say the white house and congress may not be all that far apart on how to handle this the solution involves canceling part of the sls rocket now but not all of it ars reports goodbye eus the compromise might be to cancel a large new upper stage for the sls rocket called the exploration upper stage this would save nasa billions of dollars and the agency could instead procure commercial upper stages such as those built by united launch alliance or blue origin to fly on sls rockets after nasa s artemis iii mission it would also eliminate the need for nasa to finish building an expensive new launch tower at kennedy space center florida the upper stage flying on the first three sls missions is no longer in production sources indicated to ars that blue origin has already begun work on a modified version of its new glenn upper stage that could fit within the shroud of the sls rocket sept 13 soyuz 2 1b

he wanted to make computers more usable and friendly to people who weren t geeks consider the cul de sac it leads off the main street past buildings of might have been to a dead end disconnected from the beaten path computing history of course is filled with such terminal diversions most never to be fully realized and many for good reason particularly when it comes to user interfaces and how humans interact with computers a lot of wild ideas deserved the obscure burials they got but some deserved better nearly every aspiring interface designer believed the way we were forced to interact with computers was limiting and frustrating but one man in particular felt the emphasis on design itself missed the forest for the trees rather than drowning in visual metaphors or arcane iconographies doomed to be as complex as the systems they represented the way we deal and interact with computers should stress functionality first simultaneously considering both what users need to do and the cognitive limits they have it was no longer enough that an interface be usable by a human it must be humane as well what might a computer interface based on those principles look like as it turns out we already know the man was jef raskin and this is his cul de sac it s sometimes forgotten that raskin was the originator of the macintosh project in 1979 raskin had come to apple with a master s in computer science from penn state university six years as an assistant professor of visual arts at the university of california san diego ucsd and his own consulting company apple co founder steve jobs subsequently hired raskin s company to write the apple ii s basic programming manual and raskin joined apple as manager of publications in 1978 raskin s work on documentation and testing combined with his technical acumen gave him outsized influence within the young company as the 40 column uppercase only apple ii was ill suited for raskin s writing apple developed a text editor and an 80 column display card and raskin leveraged his ucsd contacts to port ucsd pascal and the p system virtual machine to the apple ii when steve wozniak developed the apple ii s floppy disk drives apple sold this as apple pascal and many landmark software programs like the apple presents apple tutorial were written in it but raskin nevertheless concluded that a complex computer by the standards of the day could never exist in quantity nor be usable by enough people to matter in his 1979 essay computers by the millions he argued against systems like the apple ii and the in development apple iii that relied on expansion slots and cards for many advanced features what was not said was that you then had the rather terrible task of writing software to support these new boards he wrote even the more sophisticated operating systems still required detailed understanding of the add ons this creates a software nightmare instead he felt that personal computers will be self contained complete and essentially un expandable as we ll see this strategy not only makes it possible to write complete software but also makes the hardware much cheaper and producible ultimately raskin believed only a low priced low complexity design could be manufactured in large enough numbers for a future world and be functional there the original macintosh was designed as an embodiment of some of these concepts apple chairman mike markkula had a 500 around 2 200 in 2025 game machine concept in mind called annie named after the playboy comic character and intended as a low end system paired with the apple ii starting at around double that price at the time and the higher end apple iii and lisa which were then in development raskin wasn t interested in developing a game console but he did suggest to markkula that a 500 computer could have more appeal and he spent several months writing specifications and design documents for the proposed system before it was approved my message wrote raskin in the book of macintosh is that computers are easy to use and useful in everyday life and i want to see them out there in people s hands and being used finding female codenames sexist he changed annie to macintosh after his favorite variety of apple though using a variant spelling to avoid a lawsuit with the previously existing mcintosh laboratory his attempt was ultimately for naught as apple later ended up having to license the trademark from the hi fi audio manufacturer and then purchase it outright anyway raskin s small team developed the hardware at apple s repurposed original cupertino offices separate from the main campus initially he put together a rough all in one concept originally based on an apple ii reportedly serial number 2 with a jury rigged monitor this evolved into a prototype chiefly engineered by burrell smith selecting for its cpu the 8 bit motorola 6809 as an upgrade from the apple ii s mos 6502 but still keeping costs low similarly a color display and a larger amount of ram would have also added expense so the prototype had a small 256x256 monochrome crt driven by the ubiquitous motorola 6845 crtc plus 64k of ram a battery and built in printer were considered early on but ultimately rejected the interface emphasized text and keyboard there was no mouse and the display was character based instead of graphical raskin was aware of early graphical user interfaces in development particularly xerox parc s and he had even contributed to early design work on the lisa but he believed the mouse was inferior to trackballs and tablets and felt such pointing devices were more appropriate for graphics than text instead function keys allowed the user to select built in applications and the machine could transparently shift between simple text entry or numeric evaluation in a calculator based language depending on what the user was typing during the project s development apple management had recurring concerns about its progress and it was nearly canceled several times this changed in late 1980 when jobs was removed from the lisa project by president mike scott after which jobs moved to unilaterally take over the macintosh which at that time was otherwise considered a largely speculative affair raskin initially believed the change would be positive as jobs stated he was only interested in developing the hardware and his presence and interest quickly won the team new digs and resources new team member bud tribble suggested that it should be able to take advantage of the lisa s powerful graphics routines by migrating to its motorola 68000 and by february 1981 smith was able to duly redesign the prototype for the more powerful cpu while maintaining its lower cost 8 bit data bus this new prototype expanded graphics to 384x256 allowed the use of more ram and ran at 8 mhz making the prototype noticeably faster than the 5 mhz lisa yet substantially cheaper however by sharing so much of lisa s code the interface practically demanded a pointing device and the mouse was selected even though raskin had so carefully tried to avoid it raskin later said he did prevail with jobs on the mouse only having one button which he believed would be easier for novices though other apple employees like larry tesler have contested his influence on this decision as jobs started to take over more and more portions of the project the two men came into more frequent conflict and raskin eventually quit apple for good in march 1982 the extent of raskin s residual impact on the macintosh s final form is often debated but the resulting 1984 macintosh 128k is clearly a different machine from what raskin originally envisioned apple acknowledged raskin s contributions in 1987 by presenting him with one of the six millionth macintoshes which he auctioned off in 1999 along with the apple ii used in the original concept after raskin s departure from apple he established information appliance inc in palo alto to develop his original concept on his own terms by this time it was almost a foregone conclusion that microcomputers would sooner or later make their way to everyone indeed home computer pioneers like jack tramiel s commodore were already selling inexpensive computers by the millions literally with the technology now evolving at a rapid pace raskin wanted to concentrate more on the user interface and the concept s built in functionality reviving the ideas he believed had become lost in the macintosh s transition he christened it with a new name swyft in terms of industrial design the swyft owed a fair bit to raskin s prior prototype as it was also an all in one machine using a built in 9 monochrome crt display unlike the macintosh however the screen was set back at an angle and the keyboard was built in it also had a small handle at the base of its sloped keyboard making it at least notionally portable disk technology had advanced so it sported a 3 5 inch floppy drive also like the macintosh albeit hidden behind a door though initially the prototype used a less powerful 8 bit mos 6502 cpu running at 2mhz the 6502 s 64k addressing limit and the additional memory banking logic it required eventually proved inadequate and the cpu was changed during development to the motorola 68008 a cheaper version of the 68000 with an 8 bit data bus and a maximum address space of 1mb raskin intended the swyft to act like an always on appliance always ready and always instant so it had a lower power mode and absolutely no power switch instead of pascal or assembly language swyft s rom operating system was primarily written in forth to reduce the size of the compiled code developer terry holmes created a tokenized version that embedded smaller tokens instead of execution addresses into forth word definitions trading the overhead of an additional lookup step which was written in hand coded assembly and made very quick for a smaller binary size this modified dialect was called tforth for token or terry the operating system supported the hardware and the demands of the on screen bitmapped display which could handle true proportional text swyft s user interface was also radically different and was based on a document metaphor most computers of that time and today mobile devices included divide functionality among separate applications that access files raskin believed this approach was excessive and burdensome writing in 1986 that b y choosing to focus on computers rather than the tasks we wanted done we inherited much of the baggage that had accumulated around earlier generations of computers it is more a matter of style and operating systems that need elaborate user interfaces to support huge application programs he expanded on this point in his 2000 book the humane interface y ou start in the generating application your first step is to get to the desktop you must also know which icons correspond to the desired documents and you or someone else had to have gone through the steps of naming those documents you will also have to know in which folder they are stored raskin thus conceived of a unified workspace in which everything was stored accessed through one single interface appearing to the user as a text editor editing one single massive document the editor was intelligent and could handle different types of text according to its context and the user could subdivide the large document workspace into multiple subdocuments all kept together this even included forth code which the user could write and evaluate in place to expand the system as they wished data received from the serial port was automatically typed into the same document and any or all text could be sent over the serial port or to a printer instead of function keys a use front key acted like an option or command key to access special features because everything was kept in one place when the user saved the system state to a floppy disk their entire workspace was frozen and stored in its entirety swyft additionally tagged the disk with a unique identifier so it knew when a disk was changed when that disk was reinserted and resumed the user picked up exactly where they left off at exactly the same point with everything they had been working on since everything was kept together and loaded en masse there was no need for a filesystem swyft also lacked a mouse or indeed any conventional means of moving the cursor around to navigate through the document swyft instead had leap keys which when pressed alone would creep forward or backward by single characters but when held down you could type a string of characters and release the key and the system would search forward or backward for that string and highlight it jumping entire pages and subdocuments if necessary if you knew what was in a particular subdocument you could find it or just leap forward to the next document marker to scan through what was there additionally by leaping to one place leaping again to another and then pressing both leap keys together you could select text as well the steps to send delete change or copy anything in the document are the same for everything in the document so the apparent simplicity of other systems is arrived at only after considerable work has been done and the user has shouldered a number of mental burdens wrote raskin adding the conceptual simplicity of the methods outlined here would be preferable in most cases the work required is also far less while around 60 swyft prototypes of varying functionality were eventually made iai s backers balked at the several million dollars additionally required to launch the product under the company s own name to increase their chances of a successful return on investment they demanded a licensee for the design instead that would insulate the small company from the costs of manufacturing and sales they found it in japanese manufacturer canon which had expanded from its core optical and imaging lines into microcomputers but had spent years unsuccessfully trying to crack the market however possibly because of its unusual interface canon unexpectedly put its electronic typewriter division in charge of the project and the iai team began work with canon s engineers to refine the hardware for mass production in the meantime iai investors prevailed upon management to find a way to release some of the swyft technology early in a less expensive incarnation this concept eventually turned into an expansion card for the apple iie raskin s team was able to adapt some of the code written for the swyft to the new device but because the iie is also a 6502 based system and is itself limited to a 64k address space it required its own onboard memory banking hardware as well with the card installed the iie booted into a scaled down swyft environment using its onboard 16k eprom with the option of disabling it temporarily to boot regular apple software unlike the original swyft the apple ii swyftcard does not use the bitmap display and appears strictly in 80 column non proportional text the swyftcard went on sale in 1985 for 89 95 approximately 270 in 2025 dollars the swyftcard s unified workspace can be subdivided into various subdocuments which appear as hard page breaks with equals signs although up to 200 pages were supported in practice the available workspace limits you to about 15 or 20 densely typed it came with a built in tutorial which began with orienting you to the leap keys i e the two apple keys and how to navigate hold one of them down and type the text to leap to or equals signs to jump to the next subdocument or tap them repeatedly to slowly creep swyft and the swyftcard implement a two phased cursor which the swyftcard calls either wide or narrow by default the cursor is narrow alternating between a solid and a partially filled block as you type the cursor splits into a wide form any text shown in inverse usually the last character you entered is what is removed when you press delete with the blinking portion after the inverse text indicating the insertion point when you creep or leap the cursor merges back into the narrow form when narrow delete deletes right as a true delete instead of a backspace if you selected text by pressing both leap keys together those become highlighted in inverse and can be cut and pasted the swyftcard software defines a use front key i e the control key as well this was most noticeable as a quick key combination for saving your work to disk to which the entire workspace was saved in one go with no filenames i e one disk equated one workspace though it had many other such functions within the program since it could be tricky to juggle floppies without overwriting them the software also took pains to ensure each formatted disk was tagged with a unique identifier to avoid accidental erasure it also implemented serial communications such that you could dial up a remote system and use use front send to send it or be dialed into and receive text into the workspace automatically swyftcards didn t sell in massive numbers but their users loved them particularly the speed and flexibility the system afforded david thornburg the designer of the koalapad tablet writing for a in november 1985 said it accomplished something that i never knew was possible it not only outperforms any apple ii word processing system but it lets the apple iie outperform the macintosh will rogers was right it does take genius to make things simple the swyft and swyftcard however were as much philosophy as interface they represented raskin s clear desire to abolish the application rather than starting a potentially different interface to do a particular task the task should be part of the machine s standard interface and be launched by direct command similarly even within the single user interface there should be no modes and no switching between different minor behaviors the interface ought to follow the same rules as much of the time as possible modes are a significant source of errors confusion unnecessary restrictions and complexity in interfaces raskin wrote in the humane interface illustrating it with the example of at one moment tapping return inserts a return character into the text whereas at another time tapping return cases the text typed immediately prior to that tap to be executed as a command even a device as simple as a push button flashlight is modal argued raskin because i f you do not know the present state of the flashlight you cannot predict what a press of the flashlight s button will do even if an individual application itself is notionally modeless raskin presented the real world example of command n commonly used to open a new document but aol s client using command m for a new e mail message the situation that gives rise to a mode in this example consists of having a particular application active the problem occurs when users employ the command n command habitually he wrote ultimately wrote raskin a n interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties in this case the particular frailty raskin concentrated on is the natural unconscious human tendency to form habitual behaviors because such habits are hard to break command actions and gestures in an interface should be consistent enough that their becoming habitual makes them more effective allowing a user to do the task without having to think about it we must design interfaces that 1 deliberately take advantage of the human trait of habit development and 2 allow users to develop habits that smooth the flow of their work if a task is always accomplished the same way he asserted then when the user has acquired the habit of doing so they will have simultaneously mastered that task raskin s next computer preserved many such ideas from the swyft but it only did so in spite of the demands of canon management who forced multiple changes during development although the original swyft though not the swyftcard had true proportional text and at least the potential for user created graphics canon s electric typewriter division was then in charge of the project and insisted on non proportional fixed width text and no graphics because that s all the official daisywheel printer could generate even though the system s bitmapped display remained a laser printer option was later added but was nevertheless still limited to text raskin wanted to use a mac like floppy drive that could automatically detect floppy disk insertion but canon required the system to use their own floppy drives which didn t not every change during development was negative much of the more complicated swyft logic board was consolidated into smaller custom gate array chips for mass production along with the use of a regular 68000 instead of the more limited 68008 which was also cheaper in volume despite only being run at 5mhz however against his repeated demands to the contrary and lengthy explanations of the rationale raskin was dismayed to find the device was nevertheless fitted with a power switch canon s engineering staff said they simply thought an error had been made and added it and by then it was too late in development to remove it canon management also didn t understand the new machine s design philosophy treating it as an overgrown word processor dubbed a work processor sic instead of the general purpose computer raskin intended and required its programmability in forth to be removed this was unpopular with raskin s team so rather than remove it completely they simply hid it behind an unlikely series of keystrokes and excised it from the manual on the other hand because canon considered it an overgrown word processor it seemed entirely consistent to keep the swyft s primary interface intact otherwise including its telecommunication features the new system also got a new name the cat thus was released the canon cat announced in july 1987 for 1 495 about 4 150 in 2025 dollars the released version came with 256k of ram with sockets to add an optional 128k more for 384k total shared between the video circuitry forth dictionary settings and document text all of which could be stored to the 3 5 inch floppy another row of solder pads could potentially hold yet another 128k but no shipping cat ever populated it its 256k of system rom contained the entirety of the editor and tforth runtime plus built in help screens all immediately available as soon as you turned it on an additional 128k rom provided a 90 000 word dictionary to which the user could add words that were also automatically saved to the same disk the system and dictionary roms came in versions for us and uk english french and german like the swyft it was based on the cat was an all in one system the 9 inch monochrome crt was retained but the floppy drive no longer had a door and the keyboard was extended with several special keys in particular the leap keys as befitting their central importance were given a row to themselves in an eye catching shade of pink function key combinations with use front are printed on the front of the keycaps the cat provided both a 1200 baud modem and a 9600bps rs 232 connector for serial data it could dial out or be dialed into to upload text text transmitted to the cat via the serial port was inserted into the document as if it had been typed in at the console a centronics style printer port connected canon s official printer options though many printers were compatible the cat can be imperfectly emulated with mame the internet archive has a preconfigured wasm version with canon roms that you can also run in your browser note that the current mame driver as of this writing will freeze if the emulated cat makes a beep and the rom s default keyboard layout assumes you re using a real cat not a pc or mac these minor issues can be worked around in the emulated cat s setup menu by setting the problem signal to flash without a beep and the keyboard to ascii the screenshots here are taken from mame and adjusted to resemble the cat s display aspect ratio the swyft and swyftcard s editing paradigm transferred to the canon cat nearly exactly preserved is the wide and narrow cursor showing both the deletion range and the insertion point as well as the use of the leap keys to creep search and select text ranges in mame the emulated leap keys are typically mapped to both alt or option keys shift leap can also be used to scroll the screen line by line tapping leap repeatedly with shift down to continue motion and the cat additionally implements a single level of undo with a dedicated undo key the use front key also persisted usually mapped in mame to the control key s text could be bolded or underlined similarly the cat inherits the same multiple document interface as the swyfts the workspace can be arbitrarily divided into documents here using the document page key mapped usually to page down in mame and the next or previous document can be leaped to by using the document page key as the target however the cat has an expanded interface compared to the swyftcard with a ruler in character positions at the bottom text and keyboard modes and open areas for on screen indicators when disk access or computations are in progress although canon had mandated that the cat s programmability be suppressed the iai team nevertheless maintained the ability to compute expressions which canon permitted as an extension of the editor metaphor simple arithmetic such as 355 113 could be calculated in place by selecting the text and pressing use front calc control g which yields the answer with a dotted underline to indicate the result of a computation here the answer is computed to the default two decimal digits of precision which is configurable pressing use front calc within that answer reopens the expression to change it computations weren t merely limited to simple figures though the cat also allowed users to store the result of a computation to a variable and reference that variable in other computations if the variables underlying a particular computation were changed its result would automatically update this capability along with the cat s non proportional font made it possible to construct simple spreadsheets right in the editor using nothing more than expressions and the tab key to create rows and columns cells can be referred to by expressions in other cells using a special function use with relative coordinates constant values in cells can simply be entered as plain text if recalculation is necessary use front calc will figure it out the cat could also maintain and sort simple line lists which when combined with the learn macro facility could be used to automate common tasks like mail merges the cat also maintained an extensive set of help screens built into rom that the swyftcard for capacity reasons was forced to load from floppy disk almost every built in function had a documentation screen accessible from use front help control n keep use front down release the n key and then press another key to learn about it when the use front key is also released the cat instantly returns to the editor similarly if the cat beeped to indicate an error pressing use front help could also explain why errors didn t trigger a modal dialogue or lock out system functions you could always continue internally the current workspace contained not only the visible text documents but also any custom words the user added to the dictionary and any additional tforth words defined in memory ordinarily there wouldn t be any given that canon didn t officially permit the user to program their own software but there were a very small number of software applications canon itself distributed on floppy disk catform which allowed the user to create fill out and print form templates and catfile canon s official mailing list application dealers were instructed to provide new users with copies though the cat here didn t come with them dealers also had special floppies of their own for in store demos and customization still iai s back door to forth quietly shipped in every cat and the clue was a curious omission in the online help use front answer this otherwise unexplained and unused key combination was the gateway if you entered the string enable forth language highlighted it and evaluated it with use front answer not calc usually control backspace in mame you d get a forth ok prompt and the system was now yours reset the cat or type re to return to the editor with forth enabled you could either enter code at the prompt or do so within the editor and press use front answer to evaluate it putting any output into the document just like applesoft basic did on the swyftcard through the forth interface it was possible to define your own words saved as part of the workspace or even hack in 68000 machine code and completely take control of the machine extensive documentation on the cat s internals eventually surfaced but no third party software was ever written for the platform during its commercial existence as it happened whatever commercial existence the cat did have turned out to be brief and unprofitable anyway it sold badly blamed in large part on canon s poor marketing which positioned it as an expensive dedicated word processor in an era where general purpose pcs and yes macintoshes were getting cheaper and could do more various apocryphal stories circulate about why the cat was killed one theory cites internal competition between the typewriter and computer divisions another holds that jobs demanded the cat be killed if canon wanted a piece of his new venture next and owen linzmeyer reports that canon did indeed buy a 16 percent stake in 1989 but regardless of the reason it lasted barely six months on the market before it was canceled the 1987 stock market crash was a further blow to the small company and an additional strain on its finances despite the cat s demise raskin s team at iai attempted to move forward with a successor machine a portable laptop that would have reportedly weighed just four pounds the new laptop christened the swyft iii used a rom based operating system based on the cat s but with a newer more sophisticated leaping technology called hyperleap at 999 it was to include a 640x200 supertwist lcd a 2400 bps modem and 512k of ram a smaller 799 swyft i would have had less memory and no modem as well as an external floppy drive and an interchange facility for file transfers with pcs and macs as raskin had originally intended the device achieved its claimed six hour battery life nicad or longer with alkaline primarily by aggressively sleeping when idle but immediately resuming full functionality when a key was pressed only two prototypes were ever made before iai s investors considering the company risky after the cat s market failure and little money coming in finally pulled the plug and caused the company to shut down in 1992 raskin retained patents on the leaping method and the swyft cat s means of saving and restoring from disk but their subsequent licensees did little with the technology and the patents in the present day have lapsed the cat is probably the best known of raskin s designs notwithstanding the macintosh for reasons discussed earlier especially as raskin never led the development of another computer again nevertheless his interface ideas remained influential and after iai s closing he continued as an author and frequent consultant and reviewer for various consumer products these observations and others were consolidated into his later book the humane interface from which this article has already liberally quoted on the page before the table of contents the book observes that w e are oppressed by our electronic servants this book is dedicated to our liberation in the humane interface raskin not only discusses concepts such as leaping and habitual command behaviors but means of quantitative assessment as well one of the more well known is fitts law after psychologist paul fitts jr that predicts the time needed to quickly move to a target area is correlated with both the size of the target and its distance from the starting position this has been most famously used to justify the greater utility of a global menu bar completely occupying the edge of a screen such as in macos because the mouse pointer stops at the edge making the menu bar effectively infinitely large and therefore easy to hit similarly hick s law or the hick hyman law named for psychologists william edmund hick and ray hyman asserts that increasing the number of choices a user is presented with will increase their decision time logarithmically given experimental constants both laws can predict how long a user will need to hit a target or make a choice notably none of raskin s systems at least as designed superficially depended on either law because they had no explicit pointing device and no menus to select from a more meaningful metric he also considers might be the card moran newell goms model goals objects methods and selection rules and how it applies to user motion while the time needed to mentally prepare press a key point to a particular position on the display or move from input device to input device say mouse to and from keyboard will vary from person to person most users will have similar times and general heuristics exist e g nonsense is easier to type than structured data however the length of time the computer takes to respond is within the designer s control and its perception can be reduced by giving prompt and accurate feedback even if the operation s actual execution time is longer similarly if we reduce keystrokes or reduce having to move from mouse to keyboard for a given task the total time to perform that task becomes less for any user although these timings can help to determine experimentally which interface is better for a given task raskin points out we can use the same principles to also determine the ideal efficiency of such interfaces an interface that gives the user no choices but still must be interacted with is maximally inefficient because the user must do some non zero amount of work to communicate absolutely no information a classic example might be a modal alert box with only one button asynchronous or transparent notifications could be better used instead likewise an interface with multiple choices will nevertheless become less efficient if certain choices are harder or more improbable to access such as buttons or click areas being smaller than others or a particular choice needing more typing to select than other choices raskin s book also considers alternative means of navigation pointing out that natural and intuitive are not necessarily synonyms for easy to use a mouse can be easy to use but it s not necessarily natural or intuitive recall scotty in star trek iv picking up the macintosh plus mouse and talking to it instead of trying to move it and then eventually having to use the keyboard raskin cites this very scene in fact besides leaping raskin also presents the idea of a zooming user interface zui allowing the user an easier way to not only reach their goal but also see themselves in relationship to that goal and within the entire workspace if you see what you want zoom in if you ve lost your place zoom out one could access a filesystem this way or a collection of applications or associated websites raskin was hardly the first to propose the zui ivan sutherland developed a primitive zui for graphics in his 1962 sketchpad along with the spatial dataland at mit and xerox parc s smalltalk with infinite desktops but he recognized its unique abilities to keep a user mentally grounded while navigating large structures that would otherwise become unwieldy this he asserts made it more humane to crystallize these concepts rather than create another new computer raskin instead started work on a software package with a team that included his son aza initially called the humane environment the s humaneeditorproject was first unveiled to the world on christmas eve 2002 though initially only as a sourceforge cvs tree since it was considered very unfinished the original early builds of the humane editor were open source and intended to run on classic mac os 9 though qemu sheepshaver and classic under tiger and earlier will also run it as before the humane editor uses a large central workspace subdivided into individual documents here separated by backtick characters our familiar two tone cursor is also maintained however although font sizes boldface italic and underlining were supported colors and additionally font sizes were still selected by traditional mac pulldown menus leaping here with a trademark is again front and center in the however instead of dedicated keys leaping is merely a part of the s internal command line termed the humane quasimode where other commands can be sent notice that the prompt is displayed as translucent text over the work area when text was deleted either by backspacing over it or pressing delete with a selected region it went to an automatically created and maintained deletion document from which it could be rescued effectively this turned the workspace into a yank buffer along with all your documents and undoing any destructive editing operation thus became merely another cut and paste deleting from the deletion document just deleted a full list of commands accepted by the quasimode was available by typing commands which in turn emitted them to the document these are based on precompiled python files which the user could edit or add to and arbitrary python expressions and code could also be inserted and run from the document workspace directly the was a fully functioning editor albeit incomplete but nevertheless capable enough to write its own documentation with despite that the intention was never to make something that was just an editor and this aspiration became more obvious as development progressed to make the software available on more platforms development subsequently changed to wxpython in 2004 and later python and pygame to handle the screen display the main development platform switched at the same time to windows and a windows demo version of this release was made although mac os x and linux could still theoretically run it if you installed the prerequisites with the establishment of the raskin center for humane interfaces rchi the s development continued under a new name archy this wayback machine link is the last version of the site before it was defaced and eventually domain parked the new name was both a pun on rchi and a reference to the don marquis characters archy and mehitabel specifically archy the typewriting cockroach whose alleged writings largely lack capital letters or punctuation because he couldn t hit the shift key at the same time archy s final release shown here was the unfinished build 124 dated december 15 2005 archy had come a long way from the original mac the finally including the same sort of online help tutorial that the swyftcard and cat featured it continued the use of a dedicated key to enter commands in this case caps lock hold it down type the command and then release it likewise dedicated leap keys returned in archy in this case left and right alt and as before selection was done by pressing both leap keys a key advancement here is that any text that would be selected if you chose to select it is highlighted beforehand in a light shade of yellow so you no longer had to remember where your ranges were as before the commands verb gave you a list of commands while the s command suite was almost entirely specific to an editor application archy s aspirations as a more complete all purpose environment were evident in particular in addition to many of the same commands we saw on the mac there were now special internet oriented commands like email and google these commands were now just small documents containing python embedded in the same workspace no more separate files you had to corral you could even change built in commands and even leap itself as you might expect besides the deletion document now just deletions things like your email were also now subdocuments and your email server settings were a subdocument too while this was never said explicitly a logical extension of the metaphor would have been to subsume webpage contents as in place parts of the workspace as well your history bookmarks and even the pages themselves could be subdocuments of their own restored immediately and ready for access when entering archy each time you exited the entire workspace was saved out into a versioned file so you could even go back in time to a recent backup if you blew it raskin was found to have pancreatic cancer in december 2004 and after transitioning the project to become archy the following january died shortly afterward on february 26 2005 in raskin s new york times obituary apple software designer bill atkinson lauded his work saying he wanted to make them computers more usable and friendly to people who weren t geeks technology journalist steven levy agreed adding that h e really spent his life urging a degree of simplicity where computers would be not only easy to use but delightful he left behind his wife linda blum and his three children aza aviva and aenea archy was the last project raskin was directly involved in and to date it remains unfinished some work continued on the environment after his death this final release came out in december 2005 nearly 10 months later but the project was ultimately abandoned and many planned innovations such as a zui of its own were never fully developed beyond a separate proof of concept similarly many of raskin s more unique innovations have yet to reappear in modern mainstream interfaces rchi closed as well and was succeeded in spirit by the chicago based humanized co founded by his son aza humanized reworked ideas from archy into enso which expanded the caps lock as command interface with a variety of verbs such as open to start applications and define to get the dictionary definition of a word and the ability to perform direct web searches by using a system wide translucent overlay similar to archy and the the program was intended to minimize the need for switching back and forth between multiple applications to complete a task in 2008 enso was made free for download and humanized s staff joined mozilla where the concept became a firefox browser extension called ubiquity in which web specific command verbs could be written in javascript and executed in an opaque pop up window activated by a hotkey combination however the project was placed on indefinite hiatus in 2009 and was never revisited and it no longer works with current versions of the browser the idea of a single workspace that you leap through also never resurfaced likewise although zui like animations have appeared more or less as eye candy in environments such as ios and gnome a pervasive zui has yet to appear in or as any major modern desktop environment that said the idea is visually appealing and some specific applications have made heavier use of the concept microsoft s 2007 deepfish project for windows mobile conceived of visually shrunken webpages for mobile devices that users could zoom into but it was dependent on a central server and had high bandwidth requirements and microsoft canceled it in 2008 a swiss company named raskin software llc apparently no official relation offers a macos zui file and media browser called raskin which has free and paid tiers on other platforms the free open source eagle mode project offers a similar file manager with media previews but also a chess application a fractal viewer and even a linux kernel configuration tool perhaps the most complete example of an operating environment built around a zui might be a2 a branch of the eth z rich oberon system the oberon system based around the oberon programming language descended from modula 2 and pascal was already notable for its unique paneled text user interface where text is clickable including text you type native oberon can be booted directly as an operating system by itself in 2002 a2 spun off initially as active object system using an updated dialect called active oberon supporting improved scheduling exception handling and object oriented programming with processes and threads able to run within an object s context to make that object active while a2 kept the oberon system s clickable text metaphor windows and gadgets can also be zoomed in or out of on an infinitely scrolling desktop which is best appreciated in action it is still being developed and older live cds are still available however the oberon system has never achieved general market awareness beyond its small niche and any forks less so limiting it to a practical curiosity for most users this isn t to say that raskin s quest for a truly humane computer has completely come to naught unfortunately in some respects we re truly backsliding with opaque operating systems that can limit your application choices or your ability to alter or customize them and despite very public changes in skinning and aesthetics the key ways that we interact with our computers have not substantially changed since the wide deployment of the xerox parc derived wimp paradigm windows icons menus and pointers ironically most visibly promoted by the 1984 post raskin macintosh a good interface unavoidably requires work and study two things that take too long in today s fast paced product cycle furthermore raskin s emphasis on built in programmability nevertheless rings a bit quaint in our era when many home users only computer may be a tablet by his standards there is little humane about today s computers and they may well be less humane than yesterday s nevertheless while raskin s ideas may have few present day implementations that doesn t mean the spirit in which they were proposed is dead too at the very least some greater consideration is given to the traditional wimp paradigm s deficiencies today particularly with multiple applications and windows and how it can poorly serve some classes of users such as those requiring assistive technology that said i hold guarded optimism about how much change we ll see in mainstream systems and raskin s editor centric application less interface becomes more and more alien the more the current app ecosystem reigns dominant but as cul de sacs go you can pick far worse places to get lost in than his and it might even make it out to the main street someday until then at least you can always still visit in an upcoming article we ll show you how folklore org canoncat net linzmeyer owen w

companies work to finalize terms as openai pursues for profit restructuring on thursday openai and microsoft announced they have signed a non binding agreement to revise their partnership marking the latest development in a relationship that has grown increasingly complex as both companies compete for customers in the ai market and seek new partnerships for growing infrastructure needs microsoft and openai have signed a non binding memorandum of understanding mou for the next phase of our partnership the companies wrote in a joint statement we are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement together we remain focused on delivering the best ai tools for everyone grounded in our shared commitment to safety the announcement comes as openai seeks to restructure from a nonprofit to a for profit entity a transition that requires microsoft s approval as the company is openai s largest investor with more than 13 billion committed since 2019 the partnership has shown increasing strain as openai has grown from a research lab into a company valued at 500 billion both companies now compete for customers and openai seeks more compute capacity than microsoft can provide the relationship has also faced complications over contract terms including provisions that would limit microsoft s access to openai technology once the company reaches so called agi artificial general intelligence a nebulous milestone both companies now economically define as ai systems capable of generating at least 100 billion in profit in may openai abandoned its original plan to fully convert to a for profit company after pressure from former employees regulators and critics including elon musk musk has sued to block the conversion arguing it betrays openai s founding mission as a nonprofit dedicated to benefiting humanity the company instead announced a modified approach where the nonprofit board would retain control while converting its for profit subsidiary into a public benefit corporation under this revised structure the nonprofit would become the largest shareholder with a stake worth more than 100 billion according to openai chairman bret taylor s announcement in may thursday s mou with microsoft suggests the companies are working to align on this modified restructuring plan the restructuring still requires approval from attorneys general in california and delaware who continue to scrutinize the proposed conversion a coalition of charitable institutions has also called on regulators to halt the plan microsoft stated in a january blog post that key elements of the partnership remain in place through 2030 including access to openai s intellectual property revenue sharing arrangements and exclusivity on openai s apis that agreement introduced a right of first refusal model for compute capacity replacing microsoft s previous exclusivity as openai s sole cloud provider the rapidly changing relationship between two formerly steadfast partners follows the ai industry s explosive growth from experimental research labs to multi hundred billion dollar infrastructure investments over the past six years since the two companies first made an investment deal openai has diversified its infrastructure partnerships including participation in the 500 billion stargate project with oracle and softbank while microsoft has expanded azure to host competing models from meta xai and deepseek despite efforts by both companies to reduce mutual dependence their fortunes remain deeply intertwined microsoft disclosed in recent earnings that azure has become a 75 billion annual business with significant contributions from openai related services
sspe is a rare but always fatal disease that destroys a child s brain a child in los angeles has died of a measles related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy the los angeles county health department reported thursday specifically the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis sspe a rare but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection the health department s announcement offered few details about the child including the child s age but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles the first of two recommended doses of measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine is given between 12 and 15 months this case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be especially for our most vulnerable community members muntu davis a los angeles county health officer said in a statement infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity vaccination is not just about protecting yourself it s about protecting your family your neighbors and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated sspe is caused by a persistent measles infection in the central nervous system children infected with the virus may go through the standard disease progression flu like symptoms high fever the telltale rash and then appear to fully recover but for a small few the virus remains and sspe emerges years later often seven to 10 years after the initial infection the los angeles health department noted that sspe generally affects about 1 in 10 000 people with measles but the risk may be much higher about 1 in 600 for those who get measles as infants such as the child who recently died with widespread vaccination which led to measles being declared eliminated from the us in 2000 sspe has virtually disappeared in the us however with vaccination rates slipping and anti vaccine misinformation and views gripping the country health experts fear seeing more of these devastating cases already the us measles case count for the year is at a 33 year high and two other children as well as an adult died from the acute infection this year symptoms of sspe emerge in horrifying stages starting with mood and personality changes including depression then uncontrolled jerky movements develop as well as vision loss dementia and seizures in the third stage jerky movements become writhing and rigidity in the last stage the parts of the brain that regulate breathing heart rate and blood pressure are damaged leading to coma and death the timeline for the stages varies widely as does the exact presentation but a heart wrenching 2016 case report of a boy in oregon detailed the horrors of what the disease can look like the boy who was 14 when he died had contracted measles in the philippines as a 1 year old his sspe symptoms began at age 11 when he was a straight a fifth grader who played soccer and basketball he began to struggle with homework drop utensils and fall asleep during meals and even while walking over the next month he became less alert and seemed confused he started having jerky movements he lost his appetite and his weight dropped 12 pounds he could no longer go to school and had a home tutor next he developed repetitive behaviors couldn t sit still frequently fell and asked seemingly meaningless questions he became aggressive and could no longer be tutored he started shuffling and walking on his toes before refusing to walk altogether he cried continuously became increasingly aggressive and began sleeping for long periods his speech declined as did his mental status he became incontinent and was unable to eat or drink in the final stage about four and a half months after the symptoms began he could no longer follow objects with his eyes didn t seem to recognize his family members faces or voices and was unresponsive to questions with no treatment for sspe he was discharged from the hospital to home hospice care and died 43 months later in 2015 this case underscores the importance of maintaining high population immunity through routine administration of 2 doses of measles containing vaccine to all eligible children the authors of the boy s case report concluded
i have to look at dollars and i have to look at time and i have to look at return nasa s interim administrator sean duffy was fired up on wednesday when he joined a teleconference to talk about new scientific findings that concerned the potential for life to have once existed on mars this is exciting news said duffy about an arrow shaped rock on mars found by nasa s perseverance rover the rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life the findings were intriguing but not conclusive further study of the rocks in an advanced lab on earth might prove more definitive duffy was ready he said to discuss the scientific results along with nasa experts on the call with reporters however the very first question and for any space reporter the obvious one concerned nasa s on again off again plan to return rocks from the surface of mars for study on earth this mission called mars sample return has been on hold for nearly two years after an independent analysis found that nasa s bloated plan would cost at least 8 billion to 11 billion president trump has sought to cancel it outright what s the latest on nasa s plans to retrieve the samples from perseverance asked marcia dunn a reporter with the associated press about small vials of rocks collected by the nasa rover on mars so listen we re looking at how we get this sample back or other samples back duffy replied what we re going to do is look at our budget so we look at our timing and you know how do we spend money better and you know what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly and so that s a current analysis that s happening right now a couple of questions later ken chang a science reporter with the new york times asked duffy why president trump s budget request called for the cancellation of mars sample return and whether that was still the president s intent i want to be really clear duffy replied this is a 30 year process that nasa has undertaken president trump didn t say hey let s forget about mars no we re continuing our exploration and by the way we ve been very clear under this president that we don t want to just bring samples back from mars we want to send our boots to the moon and to mars and that is the work that we re doing amit kshatriya the new associate administrator of nasa even said maybe we ll send our equipment to test this sample to mars itself all options are on the table so that was a couple of questions asking about a robotic mars sample return mission which under nasa s most recent plan was slated to launch no earlier than 2030 duffy still offered no real answers beyond a vague we re looking at it since china now says it will launch a mars sample return mission in 2028 i asked duffy a few minutes later whether this administration was comfortable with its geopolitical rival achieving such a spaceflight feat first first eric i love you guys all asking me questions duffy replied we got some of the brightest people at nasa with us i ll take them i was hoping your questions are going to be more on you know more on this exciting news that we have today but you know listen we re running our plan we re making the right calls for america and for our partners and again we lead and we are going to continue to lead but it s always important that we keep pushing we have to push because we are in another space race i want to make sure we re making the right decisions right and i have to look at dollars and i have to look at time and i have to look at return and as we do that we thought well there could be a better way to do this to get these samples back duffy should not be surprised that reporters were addressing questions directly to him since he was named as interim nasa administrator a former congressman duffy is also currently the us secretary of transportation on july 9 duffy has participated in no nasa news conferences and outside of appearances on fox news has conducted a very limited number of interviews so it is natural that during his first appearance before reporters he received a majority of the questions duffy is not wrong that a new leader of nasa should be reviewing the agency s decisions especially in light of the competition between the united states and china to ensure taxpayers are getting a great return on their investment in the us space agency what does seem clear after this week is that despite a line in the president s budget request for fiscal year 2026 calling for the cancellation of nasa s mars sample return mission duffy is open to negotiating with congress about the best path forward but he s not ready to talk about it yet however based upon discussions with several sources there appear to be three potential paths that nasa is considering it has already been a turbulent year for the trump administration and nasa s science programs the white house nasa and congress already face a host of thorny questions about the future of more than two dozen science missions the white house wants to essentially turn off a number of spacecraft already operating in space it has also sought to cut funding for the perseverance rover which made this significant discovery because of these pending fights it seems like a resolution on mars sample return may not come for some time

looking to cut out sugary sodas or energy drinks but don t enjoy drinking plain water there are now plenty of healthy drinks out there for those who want a fun beverage without the added sugar or calories some contain probiotics for gut health electrolytes for hydration magnesium for relaxation and other ingredients that aim to give your body a boost after years of testing various drinks as wellness editors these are the best healthy beverages we keep buying with our own money for this list we didn t choose a best healthy beverage overall because each drink offers something unique some have probiotics while others offer magnesium or electrolytes we felt it would be unfair to choose the best overall and instead went with each drink s individual category why we like it created in 2018 you ve likely seen olipop pop up in your local grocery or health food store the soda contains prebiotics botanicals and plant fiber to support digestive health it s also low sugar high fiber low calorie vegan gluten free and gmo free and it contains no artificial sweeteners preservatives flavors or colors it s marketed as a new kind of soda meant to be good for you while tasting good too i ve been a fan of olipop for years the brand recently sent me its tropical punch vintage cola root beer cream soda classic grape orange squeeze doctor goodwin and lemon lime sodas but i have also purchased the following flavors on my own peaches and cream strawberry vanilla cherry cola watermelon lime banana cream cherry vanilla crisp apple and ridge rush i enjoyed all of these flavors and found that they are perfect in mocktails whether they are the base of the drink or added alongside a nonalcoholic liquor my favorites are strawberry vanilla orange squeeze and lemon lime who is it best for this soda is best for people who enjoy the flavor and sparkling nature of soda but want to avoid the added sugar and calories while getting some extra fiber who should not get it those with certain digestive conditions should be careful about drinking prebiotic sodas make sure to consult your doctor first before giving them a try why we like it launched by health and wellness brand bloom nutrition in july 2025 bloom pop is a prebiotic soda made with only 20 calories and 3 4 grams of sugar per can it s also caffeine free and contains no artificial preservatives flavors or colors the brand sent me all its flavors to try and my favorites are shirley temple and raspberry lemonade there s also strawberry cream watermelon lime and classic orange all of which are carbonated who is it best for i d recommend this soda alternative to people who want the added prebiotics these flavors are also sweeter than other alternatives i ve tried so if you have a sweet tooth that isn t satisfied by other drinks on this list bloom pop may work for you who should not get it if you have a digestive condition talk to your doctor about whether prebiotic sodas are right for you why we like it in 2017 recess was launched to provide drinks designed to calm you down in addition to recess the brand s hemp and adaptogen drink there are also the magnesium and adaptogen recess mood alcohol free recess zero proof and recess mood powder lines for testing recess sent me its recess mood variety pack in the flavors strawberry rose blood orange peach ginger and black cherry they contain magnesium l threonate l theanine and lemon balm to help you relax and unwind i genuinely enjoyed all of these drinks but my favorite from the mood line was strawberry rose who is it best for the recess mood line is best for people who want a low sugar low calorie drink that helps their body relax who should not get it if you have a health condition that affects your magnesium levels such as kidney failure or certain bleeding disorders or makes your body sensitive to magnesium consult your doctor before trying this drink why we like it inspired by the marine nutrient rich foods she grew up eating in japan alissa miky founded oomee in 2019 oomee harnesses the power of red seaweed that s been supporting wellness in japan for over 400 years miky tells cnet what makes our marine plant beverage unique is how it works with your body naturally the agar agar in red seaweed provides satiety support to help you feel full and satisfied while our proprietary seabiotics blend supports overall wellness and balance it s like having the ocean s ancient wisdom in a refreshingly modern format low in sugar 20 calories vegan gluten free and with no artificial flavors or carbonation oomee is the only us company that has partnered with the market leader in japanese agar agar which has created special processing technology to ensure high quality agar agar the brand sent me its three flavors to try and i enjoyed both the taste and texture of them all but my favorite is blueberry and elderflower who is it best for i d recommend this drink to anyone who s looking for a fun uncarbonated drink that s low in calories and sugar but still tastes great it also doesn t have a seaweed y taste so that s nothing to worry about who should not get it if you have a digestive condition talk to your doctor about whether a drink with fiber is right for you i would also avoid this beverage if you have a seaweed or agar agar allergy why we like it if you crave the nostalgic taste of a can of iced tea in the summer but don t want all that extra sugar halfday s noncarbonated iced teas are a great alternative inspired by co founder kayvon jahanbakhsh s battle with ulcerative colitis halfday was created to bring forth a new era of iced teas with 6 grams of prebiotic fiber lower calories and 3 5 grams of sugar they re also vegan gluten free and kosher certified note that depending on the flavor halfday contains between 25 50mg of caffeine per can i ve tried the following flavors from the brand lemon tea peach tea green tea raspberry tea sweet tea and classic half and half a mix of iced tea and lemonade the only one i haven t tried is the limited edition tropical tea my favorites are peach tea and the classic half and half who is it best for halfday would be great for anyone who loves iced tea but wants less sugar in their drink and extra prebiotic fiber added who should not get it if you have a digestive condition talk to your doctor about whether you

kombucha in cans glow up kombucha with added benefits and the gut healthy soda sunsip its drinks are vegan organic gluten free and non gmo the brand offers plenty of flavors i ve tried pink lady apple

of coconut water vita coco was launched in 2003 to help make the beverage more mainstream in the us the coconuts are sourced from small farms in tropical locations flash pasteurized vitamin c and 1 sugar are added to maintain flavor and freshness before being packaged in a tetra pak in addition to its original flavor vita coco offers pineapple and peach mango flavors i ve tried the pineapple but sometimes it s a bit too sweet for me the brand also offers farmers organic coconut water its only organic product and extra coconut with coconut puree vita coco is a great option for staying hydrated without the added sugars and artificial dyes found in traditional sports and energy drinks it is also packed with electrolytes who is it best for if you aren t looking for 100 raw coconut water that foregoes pasteurization and is more affordable than harmless harvest vita coco may be the right coconut water for you who should not get it this product is pasteurized not organic unless it s farmers organic and contains 1 added sugar if any of those factors bother you and you d prefer the opposite you may want to give harmless harvest a try but you will pay more why we like it harmless harvest

centered ethical and responsible commercial partnerships has 100 recycled plastic bottles and its coconuts are regenerative organic certified at the bronze level the drink also has one ingredient nam hom coconuts grown in thailand with natural electrolytes and no added sugars it starts clear but turns pink over time because its antioxidants naturally react with light the brand also doesn t thermally pasteurize its product of all its products i ve tried the harmless harvest organic coconut water organic sparkling coconut water and organic coconut smoothie my favorite is their original

more on coconut water since it s 100 coconut water with no extra ingredients it s great for providing electrolytes before or after a workout who should not get it people with health conditions

absorbable form of magnesium designed to help the body manage stress and fight fatigue while giving you an energy boost you may remember that vybes used to sell cbd drinks but these have been discontinued due to state regulations i ve tried both the pineapple passionfruit and blueberry mint flavors and my body felt more relaxed right after i finished the drink i also enjoyed the unique flavor combinations and thought they were tasty other flavors i haven t tried include blackberry hibiscus blood orange lime peach ginger and strawberry lavender who is it best for vybes is great for anyone who wants a drink that helps their body relax and find balance i like to treat myself to a bottle after a stressful day who should not get it if you have a medical condition that makes your

artificial sweeteners which can cause gi upset also note that the drink is more expensive at around 7 making it less budget friendly why we like it founded in 2018 and loved by both meghan markle and oprah clevr blends creates instant plant based superlattes and superteas made with functional ingredients like adaptogens probiotics natural electrolytes and superfoods to help with mood stress sleep and energy from its superlatte line which can be made hot or iced i ve tried the matcha chai sleeptime rose cocoa and golden latte they also offer honey pistachio matcha honey lavender matcha coffee mocha london fog and chill chai superteas come in the flavors strawberry lemonade yuzu lemonade and mango green the promised effects of the chai matcha and sleeptime superlattes were assessed during a 12 week third party clinical study my number one favorite is the golden superlatte made with turmeric it is the best golden milk i ve ever tasted and is a drink i keep repurchasing my second favorite is the clevr blends matcha but i m sensitive to caffeine so don t repurchase often who is it best for clevr s superlattes are best for people who want an instant hot beverage packed with adaptogens mushrooms probiotics and more who should not get it if you re pregnant breastfeeding or a kid clevr blends states that you should consult your healthcare provider before consuming the beverage if you re sensitive to monk fruit extract or erythritol a sugar alcohol you may also want to avoid this drink note that some of the brand s beverages do contain caffeine why we like it moment is one of the few drinks i ve tried that claim to help calm you and actually delivers the brand uses adaptogens like l theanine and ashwagandha to support mindfulness and relaxation whenever i reach for one of these drinks i start to feel calm in about 20 minutes it also tastes incredibly delicious almost like a dessert in a can without being overly sweet who is it best for anyone who wants a functional drink to unwind especially in the afternoon or as part of their ritual before bed i would also recommend it to people looking to cut caffeine or alcohol as it makes a great mocktail too who should not get it if you have a known sensitivity to adaptogens or are already taking supplements that contain ashwagandha it s worth checking with your doctor first since the purpose of this drink is to help you relax i also wouldn t recommend it to anyone looking for a jolt of energy why we like it erha is a functional drink that doesn t just hydrate you but also supports how you feel it offers three drinks to support common pain points like restlessness bloating and allergies whether you re stomach is feeling achey you re a little stuffy or overstimulated erha s intention set is crafted with plant based ingredients that support those needs i tried all three flavors and each one felt like a mini ritual in my daily routine who is it best for people looking for relief from stomach issues allergies or stress this drink lineup provides everyday support who should not get it the flavors are subtle and herbal so if you like bold and sweet flavors this drink is not for you why we like it be love offers hydration and functionality in a clean and elevated way each can delivers electrolytes while other ingredients like magnesium help support mood and stress i like that these drinks also help balance blood ph levels i often reach for these after my workouts or when i need a break from writing and they help me feel replenished without the sugar rush i feel after having energy drinks who is it best for people looking for an electrolyte drink with clean ingredients also great for those looking for a post workout recovery drink who should not get it if you re looking for a high sodium or high sugar electrolyte drink the ones you d use after endurance sports be love may be too light why we like it i love everything about this beverage s branding it really flips the script on what a wellness drink should look like it s just water or flavored still and sparkling water in a tall can that looks like it belongs at a heavy metal concert branding aside i like to keep these in my fridge for whenever i m bored with plain water the flavored options aren t loaded with added sugars and the still water version tastes super crisp who is it best for ideal for those who want to avoid sugary drinks or even those who want to limit drinking alcohol but miss the feeling of a tallboy can who should not get it not for folks looking to get extra nutritional benefits like added vitamins or adaptogens when it comes to picking the right healthy beverage for your taste and preferences there are multiple factors to consider below we outline them so you can find the right drink for you if you follow a specific diet or are looking for specific ingredients this can help you narrow down the best drink for you examples include gluten free vegan nut free low sugar or zero sugar and no artificial flavors or sweeteners you ll also want to think about what is added to the drink such as magnesium different botanicals adaptogens and electrolytes and which would best suit your lifestyle or health concerns amelia ti a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in new york who is also part of cnet s medical review board adds some adaptogens for instance may not be suitable for pregnant people or those on certain medications some healthy beverages cost more than others especially if you want to buy a pack consider your budget how many people you re buying for and how often you plan to purchase these drinks it s also helpful to think about how often you buy a coffee tea juice or smoothie from a local establishment perhaps buying these beverages in their place will help you save do you plan to buy just one can of your favorite healthy beverage when grocery shopping or do you want to buy a 6 or 12 pack for your entire family think about how many people you re shopping for and how often you want to sip the beverage also if you plan to keep them cold think about how much space you have available in your refrigerator the best part of trying new beverages is finding your favorite flavor if you re trying to reduce your soda intake perhaps you want a drink that replicates your favorite soda flavor or if you prefer bold fruity flavors consider drinks that offer those the best part is that there is truly a flavor for everyone do you like sparkling beverages or prefer your drinks still this will also help you narrow down your selection if you like healthier carbonated beverages because you want to cut back on soda consider something sparkling however if you don t like the feel of carbonation a still coconut water might be more your speed as wellness editors and writers we have spent years testing healthy beverages to see what they offer if they fulfill their promises and if they taste good we narrowed it down to the specific drinks that have stood out to us and that we would continue to purchase again and again factors we considered were dietary notes added ingredients price carbonation the drink category and sizes available while everyone should make sure they re drinking enough water every day other healthy beverages include green tea kombucha kefir fruit smoothies and coconut water water is the best liquid to drink every day because it is essential for your body to function drinks high in electrolytes like coconut water are great for replenishing your body and helping you rehydrate especially after a workout unhealthy can be subjective since it can be dependent on one s medical conditions says ti most unhealthy drinks are those high in added sugars artificial ingredients or stimulants with no nutritional value like sugary sodas or highly caffeinated energy drinks

apple announced ios 26 at its worldwide developers conference in june but it said at the time it would release the update to the general public this fall so i looked at past apple events in september and earlier ios releases to predict when the company would release ios 26 and i was right apple announced online that ios 26 will be released as a free update on monday apple usually releases updates around 1 p m et 10 a m pt so that means everyone only has less than 72 hours until iphones can get new features like a liquid glass design call screening and new ringtones the company announced the software update s release the same day it held its awe dropping event on tue where it showcased the new iphone 17 17 pro and the thin iphone air here s how i predicted ios 26 s release date before apple even announced it don t miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab based reviews add cnet as a preferred google source ios 26 will introduce a new liquid glass design to your iphone apple held its awe dropping event on tuesday sept 9 the same day i predicted the company would in the past 10 years apple has only held its september event between sept 7 and 14 usually on tuesday six times with a few wednesdays thrice and one monday we don t usually have to wait long after apple s september event for ios updates to be released apple doesn t usually announce the release of ios versions but it does stick close to a script from year to year that means you too can perform acts of apple divination if you understand the history of its fall events and ios releases apple ran its awe dropping event on tuesday sept 9 the same day i predicted the company would after most of apple s september events the company releases the next ios within a week in 2024 for example apple s event was held on sept 9 and ios 18 was released seven days later on sept 16 in 2023 apple s event was held on sept 12 and it released ios 17 six days later on sept 18 there s only been one year in the past decade where it took longer than a week for apple to release the next ios version 2019 even then apple still released the next ios version nine days after its september event the number of days between apple s september event and the release of the next ios version has also trended slightly downward in the past decade in 2015 apple released ios 9 on sept 16 seven days after the company s september event and in 2022 apple released ios 16 on sept 12 five days after the company s sept 7 event in that same timeframe apple released six ios versions within a week of the event so the math pointed me to ios 26 coming out six or seven days after its sept 9 event apple also released the past four ios versions on the monday following its september events so this could be the new norm and apple will release all future ios versions on the monday after its september event so it s most likely that apple will release ios 26 on a monday maybe that explanation takes some of the mystique out of my prediction but that s how i came up with monday sept 15 as the ios 26 release date apple confirmed it shortly after its awe dropping event on sept 9 for more on ios 26 here are my first impressions of the beta how to enable call screening in the beta and all the new features apple said it will bring to your device later this year you can also check out our ios 26 cheat sheet
