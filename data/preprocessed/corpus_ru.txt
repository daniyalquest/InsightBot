the eu must improve relations with us president donald trump the most influential man in the world and adapt to his way of doing business and politics the bloc s foreign policy chief kaja kallas has said kallas made the remarks in an interview with german outlet rnd published on friday she was asked whether the eu can still trust trump after a much criticized trade deal that imposed a 15 tariff on most exports from the bloc while lifting tariffs on us industrial goods the deal which also involved shifting from russian energy to us imports sparked backlash from eu officials who said it favors washington the us is and remains our most important partner but the new administration has clearly changed how it conducts policy and official business we europeans must adapt and adjust to their way of working kallas said adding that trump s tariffs have become a new benchmark for how well a country gets along with the us trump is the most influential man in the world we simply have to learn how to work with him kallas also said any settlement of the ukraine conflict is unlikely without trump s involvement claiming that only the us has the power to force russia into serious peace negotiations she expressed hope that trump will follow through on earlier threats and impose further sanctions on moscow russia has not been targeted with us tariffs due to the existing sanctions but trump has threatened tariffs on its trade partners if the ukraine conflict is not resolved quickly last month he doubled the tariffs on india to 50 accusing it of aiding moscow by buying russian oil and defense equipment and hinted at new measures against china this week trump signaled that he could further sanction russia if nato members stop buying its oil arguing that the military bloc s commitment to ukraine peace efforts is insufficient russia has denounced the western sanctions as illegal and has said it is open to talks on ukraine but stressed that any peace deal must address the root causes of the conflict and include ukrainian neutrality demilitarization and recognition of the new territorial realities
denmark has shown its hostile stance towards russia by agreeing to host a weapons production site for the ukrainian military foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova has said speaking at a press briefing on friday zakharova condemned plans by copenhagen to establish a solid rocket fuel production facility for ukraine s long range flamingo cruise missiles which ukrainian officials say could reach as far as siberia the facility will be operated by the ukrainian defense company fire point and is due to begin manufacturing fuel near skrydstrup air base in south jutland in december zakharova stressed that the missiles are intended to strike deep inside russia adding that denmark is the first among the sponsors of the terrorist kiev regime to provide its territory for producing weapons components for combat use against peaceful cities of our country this reckless move confirms copenhagen s hostile militarist course which along with other countries that are hostile to russia sabotages efforts for a political diplomatic resolution of the ukraine crisis the spokeswoman said according to zakharova denmark is also heightening the risk of further escalation and encouraging neo nazis in ukraine to carry out new barbaric crimes against the civilian population of russian regions she also criticized the danish government for what she described as a push to prioritize the development of its own military industrial complex and enrich itself through the conflict while ignoring safety environmental and local community concerns zakharova added that russia will defend its interests while taking adequate military technical measures to counter the emerging threats to its national security according to ukrainian leader vladimir zelensky the flamingo which was unveiled last month can travel up to 3 000km though mass production is not expected for several months fire point the company producing the missiles is also facing an anti corruption probe at home over allegations of misleading the government on pricing and deliveries moscow has accused ukraine of routinely launching strikes deep into russia targeting critical infrastructure and residential areas russia has condemned western weapons shipments to kiev warning that they only prolong the conflict without changing the outcome
european nato states are reportedly dismayed and confused by washington s reaction to an alleged russian drone incursion into polish airspace according to reuters some members of the bloc view us president donald trump s reluctance to outright blame moscow for the incident on wednesday as a sign that he is not committed enough to their defense the news agency reported on saturday citing unnamed european officials us aircraft also played no role in repelling the alleged attack according to reuters us officials said it was because the dutch military was responsible for polish airspace within nato at the time trump s handling of the incident has ranged from dismay to confusion and unease reuters said a german official told the news agency that european nato members cannot rely on anything with the trump administration an eastern european diplomat called washington s silence on the matter almost deafening while an italian official told reuters that nato members were mostly displeased with the us reaction the polish government stated that its military tracked at least 19 alleged violations of its airspace by russian drones over a seven hour period on wednesday describing the episode as deliberate and unprecedented it also convened an emergency un security council meeting over the incident trump downplayed the accusations suggesting that the alleged incident could have been a mistake he also said he was not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation and expressed hope that it would just come to an end moscow responded by saying warsaw s claims were not supported by evidence and hyped up by the european party of war drones used in strikes against ukrainian military targets could not physically reach polish territory russia s envoy to the un vassily nebenzia said european leaders including french president emmanuel macron and european commission chief ursula von der leyen condemned the alleged incursion as reckless and expressed solidarity with poland
a new minister has joined the cabinet of a small european country her name is diella she doesn t eat drink smoke walk or breathe and according to the prime minister who hired her she doesn t take bribes either diella isn t human and she s not quite a robot either she s an algorithm and as of september she is officially albania s minister for public procurement for the first time in history a government has given a cabinet level post to artificial intelligence sounds like sci fi but the appointment is real and has set a precedent are you ready to be governed by ai until recently diella lived quietly on albania s e government portal answering routine citizen questions and fetching documents then prime minister edi rama promoted her to ministerial rank tasking her with something far more important deciding who wins state contracts a function worth billions in public money and notorious for bribery favoritism and political kickbacks rama has framed diella as a clean break with the country s history of graft even calling her impervious to bribes but that s rhetoric not a guarantee whether her resistance to corruption is technically or legally enforceable is unclear if she were hacked poisoned with false data or subtly manipulated from inside there might be no fingerprints the plan is for diella to evaluate bids cross check company histories flag suspicious patterns and eventually award tenders automatically officials say this will slash the bureaucracy s human footprint save time and make procurement immune to political pressure but the legal mechanics are murky nobody knows how much human oversight she will have or who is accountable if she makes a mistake there is no court precedent for suing an algorithmic minister there is also no law describing how she can be removed from office critics warn that if her training data contains traces of old corruption she might simply reproduce the same patterns in code but faster others point out that albania has not explained how diella s decisions can be appealed or even if they can be appealed public reaction to diella has been mixed with fascination tempered by unease even diella will be corrupted in albania one viral post read critics warn she might not be cleansing the system just hiding the dirt inside the code albania says it will keep a human in the loop but hasn t explained how or who there is no legal framework there is no appeals process there is no off switch and if diella appears to work others might follow the copycats wouldn t arrive with press conferences or cabinet photo ops they could slip quietly into procurement systems hidden under euphemisms like decision support running entire state functions long before anyone dares call them ministers albania may be the first to seat an algorithm beside ministers but it isn t alone in trying to wire code into the state most are just doing it quietly in fragments and behind thicker curtains in the united arab emirates there s already a minister of state for artificial intelligence a human omar sultan al olama tasked with reshaping the country s entire digital bureaucracy around machine learning he hasn t handed power to ai but he s building the pipes that could one day carry it spain has created aesia one of europe s first dedicated ai oversight agencies to audit and license the algorithms used inside government it s a regulatory skeleton the sort of legal scaffolding you d want in place before letting a machine anywhere near a minister s job tax authorities are going further still in the united states the irs uses ai to sift through the filings of hedge funds and wealthy partnerships trying to spot hidden evasion schemes canada scores taxpayers by algorithm and forces agencies to file algorithmic impact reports before deploying new models spain is rolling out tools to catch fraud patterns in real time italy is testing machine learning to flag fake vat claims and has even built a chatbot for its auditors india says it is scaling up ai led crackdowns on phantom deductions and armenia is piloting systems that scan invoices and flag suspicious behavior before a human ever sees them france has gone visual pointing algorithms at aerial imagery to catch undeclared swimming pools and hit owners with surprise tax bills proof that ai can already move money from citizens to the state latvia runs a tax chatbot named toms that s been answering citizen questions since 2020 scaling the reach of its bureaucracy romania s rural investment agency now uses robotic process automation and ai to rip documents from state databases and rush eu funding to farmers not glamorous but very effective meanwhile estonia denmark singapore south korea and japan are embedding ai deeper into their bureaucratic machinery classifying government content triaging cases personalizing services even predicting who might need healthcare or welfare next estonia calls it krattai a vision of every citizen talking to government through a single voice interface denmark is preparing to roll ai tools across all public services even as rights groups warn about opaque welfare algorithms singapore s govtech unit is building ai products for ministries south korea is piloting ai in social programs japan is pushing sector wide adoption in health and administration and in nepal the government has stopped talking about if and started planning how its new national ai policy lays out a path to bring machine learning into public services modernize the bureaucracy and build legal guardrails before deploying it at scale no algorithm has decision making power there yet but the blueprint exists everywhere you look the state is being rewired line by line of code for now these systems whisper rather than rule they flag risks pre fill forms sort audits move money so far only albania has asked an algorithm to decide right now no country has handed full political power to an algorithm what exists is a kind of two track world most states use administrative ai the quiet kind risk scoring fraud detection case triage or chatbots it already shapes who gets audited how fast grants move and which files land first on a civil servant s desk it doesn t write laws or sign contracts but it nudges outcomes invisibly constantly albania is different diella doesn t just advise she is meant to award to decide who gets public money that crosses a line from algorithm as tool to algorithm as authority could this be the future possibly but only if several unlikely things fall into place the law would have to catch up creating clear rules for liability appeals and even removal from office regulators would have to bite with real audits like spain s aesia rather than paper tigers and models would have to stay stable under pressure not blackmail sabotage or go rogue when threatened as some already have in lab tests we are not there yet but the precedent now exists
a russian court has blocked a website that advertised contract killings and covert assassinations disguised as accidents according to court documents it remains unclear whether anyone was killed or charged in connection with the site the banned platform reportedly offered killings staged as accidents such as workplace injuries or falls from heights as well as suicides and poisonings made to look like heart attacks prices ranged from 170 000 rubles 2 000 to 400 000 rubles 4 700 ria novosti reported on friday the investigation was launched by a military prosecutor who discovered that information about providing services for the killing of a person was freely available to an unlimited number of users the nikulinsky district court in moscow ruled that the website contained prohibited information on how to order a murder emphasizing that the content was accessible to any internet user including minors since the site in question freely provides materials on the possibility of offering services for the killing of a person the court concludes that the information it contains is subject to recognition as prohibited for dissemination as are actions related to publishing such information the ruling stated although no one has yet been charged in relation to the hitman for hire website the court noted that organizers instigators and accomplices in contract killings are all subject to criminal prosecution under russian law a journalistic investigation into russia s contract killing market conducted by gazeta ru last year uncovered hundreds of online ads offering to kill or injure people with prices ranging from tens of thousands to several million rubles the report noted that while such cases were rare in 2018 they now number in the hundreds each year often involving more experienced hitmen it also highlighted a shift in platforms from the darknet to messenger apps and disguised online channels as well as a move from word of mouth promotion to online advertising the investigative committee has opened dozens of cases in recent years while politically motivated assassinations often attract media attention analysts say that most killings are tied to personal disputes or business related conflicts

china has warned that confrontational and provocative rhetoric over the ukraine conflict is creating dangerous spillover effects after poland accused russia of a deliberate drone attack and convened an emergency un security council meeting speaking at the session on friday china s deputy permanent representative to the un geng shuang said beijing has taken note of the recent statements and responses from poland russia and belarus and called on all parties to avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment this drone incident is a spillover of the ukraine crisis geng stated any misunderstanding or misjudgment will deepen the trust deficit any confrontational rhetoric may spark an escalation and any military clash could trigger broader instability poland said its air defenses tracked at least 19 airspace violations and shot down three drones on wednesday describing the incident as an unprecedented and deliberate attack kiev and multiple eu officials immediately echoed this narrative while nato announced a new military deployment to bolster the bloc s posture russian envoy vassily nebenzia dismissed the claims as hysteria arguing that only the kiev regime and the european party of war would benefit the russian defense ministry has said its drone operations were directed at ukrainian military targets and none were aimed at poland the ministry added that the maximum range of russian drones that allegedly crossed the polish border is less than 700 km and reiterated that moscow was ready to hold consultations with warsaw the chinese ambassador said the international community needs goodwill rather than hostility and called for adherence to three principles no expansion of the battlefield no escalation of the conflict and no provocation by any party us president donald trump downplayed the incident suggesting it could have been a mistake but polish prime minister donald tusk doubled down insisting it wasn t polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski added that anyone who doubts the narrative is an accomplice of russian propaganda

albania will soon be the first country to have an ai chatbot as a virtual minister in an effort to clamp down on corruption by turning to an unbribable digital official the balkan nation ranked 80th out of 180 countries in transparency international s corruption perceptions index for last year diella meaning sun in albanian will be responsible for all public procurement in albania moving forward prime minister edi rama said at a party assembly in tirana on thursday the bot initially launched earlier in the year on the e albania platform as an ai virtual assistant that helped citizens with government services its avatar appears as a young brunette woman dressed in traditional albanian garb diella is the first cabinet member who isn t physically present but is virtually created by ai rama said the public procurement must be transformed which we need to gradually transfer to ai making albania a country where public tenders are 100 free from corruption he added the awarding of public sector contracts in the balkan country has long been a source of graft scandals complicating albania s eu bid since it was officially granted candidate status in 2014 in recent months the country was rocked by a major corruption scandal centered around waste management in april seven former officials were convicted on abuse of power charges the european commission regularly highlights the problem of corruption in the balkan state as part of its rule of law reports
rt with the advent of generative ai a joke appeared on the internet comparing the future envisioned by utopian fiction authors with robots doing menial physical work and humans free to pursue creativity to the reality where chatgpt stable diffusion et al are creating texts and pictures while humans work minimum wage jobs at fast food and amazon warehouses is this anti utopian humor justified mathew maavak yes the humor is more than justified in fact it is no longer funny it took barely a decade for the sci fi fantasy of robot butlers freeing humanity for art and leisure to be annihilated by reality instead of robots flipping burgers we have ai painting portraits while humans flip the burgers until robots replace them ai safety expert dr roman yampolskiy recently warned that artificial general intelligence agi and superintelligence may wipe out 99 of jobs in the near future skeptics used to argue that robots lacked the dexterity for real work like plumbing sanitation car repairs and warehouse drudgery that is changing fast true humanoid robots still need refinement and their maintenance costs will slow uptake their long term reliability needs to be extensively tested failure to do so will result in corporate disasters in a manner similar to the string of bankruptcies facing western automakers who rushed out models without undertaking extensive long term tests the immediate job threat therefore is not to plumbers or janitors it is to the supposedly safe knowledge class why hire a lawyer when ai can draft affidavits in seconds without the pomp theatrics and obscene billing that lawyers cling to like a birthright most people don t realize that they can represent themselves pro se to use a legal term with ai s help if not for numerous obstacles placed by the legal fraternity why consult a university or library when llms like chatgpt or deepseek can synthesize information in fields ranging from astrophysics to the dead sea scrolls in the span of a coffee break which single professor can match that range and output why trouble the neighbor or a mechanic about the capabilities of a new car when ai can explain every system with clarity and patience journalism is no safer copy editors proofreaders and even anchors should have been redundant by now if ai models can already sell fashion even to those who crave a human appeal why not deliver the evening news via an ai anchor i tell you one reason why there will be lots of hesitancy in terms of mass adoption by the legacy media an advanced ai anchor quite ironically may not ask scripted questions to get scripted answers the media in particular is staring at seismic shocks ahead i joked in the newsroom nearly 30 years ago that all we really needed was software with templates for each kind of story it wasn t a joke after all as it turned out to be quite prophetic rt to be clear generative ai can be an ingenious tool and assistant in many lines of work who do you think benefits the most from it mm to answer that you need to divide humans into two broad categories the harnesser a term i coined and the herd notice that one can be both singular and plural while the other is always plural this is natural as 99 of humanity is driven by herd instincts they have consistently surrendered their critical faculties to accommodate the herd and find safety in their respective comfort zones those safe zones are now being obliterated by ai and many are sleepwalking into a future which has no place for them this presages massive social upheavals globalist movers and shakers foresaw this specter long ago which is why they commissioned futurists like yuval noah harari to enunciate a mass opiated future for so called useless eaters the harnesser by contrast is far more than a critical thinker they can turn an impossible situation into a creative opportunity think of a sailor catching the wind in his sails and cutting through stormy waters the harnesser has cultivated often over decades the trait of sailing against the current they have neuroplastically conditioned themselves to question everything the harnesser also applies a systems approach to problems grasps complexity with ease and may possess an uncanny repertoire of knowledge their interaction with generative ai is not a one sided copy and paste exercise they will interrogate and even correct it their tacit knowledge diverse refined and somewhat inscrutable remains beyond ai s reach here is an example to illustrate the point i am making when i received these questions from rt the biblical verse of daniel 12 4 immediately came to mind the verse reads in the king james version but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased knowledge has indeed increased exponentially so for those who choose to harness it but what does to and fro mean what does the original text say i interrogated chatgpt because i suspected there was more to it and i was right to and fro appears only in the masoretic text the theodotion text septuagint omits it entirely while the old greek version of daniel contains a surprising addendum i leave it to the curious reader to examine the variations themselves what truly caught my attention however was the hebrew rendering of the verse in the dead sea scrolls it included the niqqud diacritical marks that did not exist at the time the scrolls were written chatgpt stood corrected after i pressed it and admitted that its rendering was speculative guesswork to cut the analogy short in the coming ai tsunami many will be tossed to and fro and left adrift in the societal ocean those who can harness this elemental force tempered by life s struggles may stand a better chance of finding their shores rt but wouldn t these so called harnessers be seen as a threat to authoritarian regimes what about political implications are there any given the fact that the companies behind generative ai engines are based almost strictly in the west mm questioning everything does come with consequences often in the form of self imposed solitude but the harnesser types i have observed also carry a healthy cynicism toward politics they are unlikely to join the herd in mass demonstrations if rallies and protests actually worked western governments would have addressed various public grievances long ago instead they have doubled down this is why i consider western governments and their satellites to be intellectually hostile despite their pretension to the contrary as for the harnesser s fate in a future political order that remains an open question the broader political implications however are plenty in geopolitics the next superpowers will be ai superpowers in asia these include russia china india iran japan taiwan and south korea with vietnam likely to join their ranks all of them take the concepts of national and ai sovereignty pretty seriously for the rest the long term outlook is rather bleak at best they will be colonized appendages of western big tech for the time being they will likely delude themselves into thinking that the brics bloc can serve as their new geopolitical and technological sugar daddy i would rather not dwell on the worst case scenario perhaps their ministers and technocrats so enamored of their world economic forum wef links should simply make yuval noah harari their chief government advisor the most immediate political question for both ai powers and laggards alike is this how prepared are governments to deal with mass unemployment on a scale induced by ai rt many you included have written about how generative ai is eroding people s ability to think for themselves reinforcing false notions and providing false information how much of a threat is this to humanity as a whole which categories of humanity are the most susceptible to it mm the cohort that benefits most from generative ai are those educated before the mass internet era it sounds paradoxical but that generation had to read books and journals scrounge for information and cultivate a regimen for inquiry most harnessers hail from this group and they are dying out it is easy to blame ai for dumbing down society but in truth society was already hopelessly dumbed down just look at the quality and theatrics of politicians today especially in the west more ominously their successors are little more than parrots reciting scripts can anyone take them seriously with their sensitivities as fragile as eggshells ai is not the cause of this decline it is merely an accelerant thanks to decades of trickle down bad governance dressed up in technocratic jargon the younger generation is not being taught how to harness ai this does not augur well for humanity what will the young people of today do tomorrow worse the herd is dumbing down ai itself generative ai thrives on feedback loops if each cycle grows dumber what happens to ai in the long run threats related to ai and humans cut both ways to avoid meltdown i suspect llm designers have fail safed their systems to personalize responses deepseek and chatgpt among others do not behave identically for everyone that raises two issues privacy and surveillance these tools can triangulate even the most anonymous user by analyzing syntax interests typos reactions typing patterns and more think about it out of 8 2 billion people ai can pinpoint who you are almost instantly even if you change handles borrow someone else s phone number relocate or cloak yourself in digital camouflage that should terrify people personally i say bring it on rt after a recent chatgpt update which disabled certain kinds of interactions there have been numerous reports of people having to break up with their ai boyfriends girlfriends why would anyone want to date a machine mm the particular attachment to ai girlfriends and boyfriends is the latest expression of a very old human tendency to anthropomorphize project emotion and form bonds with non human objects when those objects provide comfort agency or reciprocal illusion the novelty is not the attachment itself but the sophistication of the object moving from wood and cloth to clockwork to pixels to adaptive ai let me explain since ancient times people have projected agency and personality onto carved images of gods or ancestors in the form of idols and statues they have personal ties with objects imbued with power such as talismans children even today are known to talk to their dolls and teddy bears in the 18th and 19th centuries mechanical dolls and automata sparked both fascination and emotional investment by the 20th century people were already forming bonds with erotic mannequins on a more meaningful note people still speak to their pets whose presence and antics can be both calming and outright funny parents articulate on behalf of babies and toddlers and this is how familial and social attachments are formed as well as the first vocabularies of a young life as children we develop our language by reading or listening to anthropomorphized stories involving animals i still remember the parting words of b rer rabbit to b rer fox at the well scene even if i forget the spur of the moment epiphanies i had included in op eds written months back ai mates however represent a new paradigm altogether for the first time ever the object of affection can talk back in real time on a variety of topics and these interactions seem more real and fulfilling than those with humans who can carry grudges tempers malice etc in my opinion ai mates are an extrapolation of the imaginary friends many children cultivate while growing up it is a form of escapism the rise in ai relationships may also be caused by growing distrust of fellow human beings compounded by a cultural drift encouraged by academics politicians and other traditional gatekeepers the lunatics are running the asylum in all social spheres and people feel let down disoriented and desperate for stability just think of the recent epidemic of gender dysphoria that was encouraged and celebrated by those in authority in that vacuum ai becomes a substitute anchor these relationships emerge from the collision of unmet human needs loneliness intimacy safety etc with hyper personalized technology in a cultural climate where traditional norms around love sex and marriage are dissolving machines become the path of least resistance ai can simulate affection and shower compliments without the conflicts of real relationships the financial and psychological costs appear minimal but the emotional entanglement can be very real all generative ai has done is turbocharge our innate instinct for attachment in fact early text based programs like eliza in the 1960s showed how easily people could be drawn into confiding in mere code rt is this just loneliness or some sign of deeper psychological issues maybe even mental disorder mm loneliness is often the entry point but it is rarely the whole story the hikikomori phenomenon in japan now being mirrored elsewhere long predated the public rollout of generative ai why do children and young adults shut themselves out of society maybe because society is getting more hypocritical cowardly and outright fake individuals enter their own simulated social matrix where conformity to lies half truths and outright nonsense is a prerequisite most human relationships are toxic to some degree one where each participant degrades the creativities or potentials of the other by subtle gaslighting this enables couples or friends to remain together and the phenomenon is broadly called the crab bucket mentality extrapolate this and you have chain ganged cohorts and ultimately a timid society that sticks with convenient lies just think of so called intellectuals who lampoon the notion of god as an imaginary fairy in the sky but have no problems concocting new gender forms this is what i referred to as the herd earlier as scripture reminds us the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it jeremiah 17 9 ai cannot truly understand the human heart either as it can only simulate human affections yet ai can certainly feel safer and more real for an increasing number of lonely people to cut a long explanation short we live in a culture of deceit and shallow connections where public life feels like a revolving circus of drama and demoralization that erosion of meaning breeds anxiety depression and other psychosocial stresses there are also elements of addiction and dependency in the context of ai relationships as virtual companions are designed to be endlessly available and affirming this bypasses the growth and friction of genuine relationships reinforcing escapism artificial bonds therefore become a substitute for human connection do ai relationships constitute a psychological disorder or is society itself a mental asylum in my view the two cannot be separated you cannot study and label the former without acknowledging the pathology of the latter clinical language already exists for paraphilias involving attachment to inanimate objects these include agalmatophilia attraction to statues or mannequins objectophilia a broader category and more specifically pygmalionism the condition of falling in love with an object of one s own creation the term comes from greek mythology where pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had made in the modern era george bernard shaw s play pygmalion reimagined the myth transforming an underclass flower girl eliza doolittle into an object of refinement what appeared to be an innocent stroke of genius becomes more unsettling when one recalls that shaw himself openly advocated for mass population culling based on perceived unworthiness sounds familiar rt the information age has provided numerous opportunities for people to meet and get together with the advent of the internet and of dating apps you don t even have to go to the pub and strike up conversations anymore is that not enough that people are turning to artificial relationships mm i will reiterate once more that many human relationships were artificial in the first place would we still talk to that colleague or superior in our workplace if we had enough money to retire or pursue our true passions relationships are forged and enforced by various types of power gradients it has been so since time immemorial it is only now in the information age as both knowledge and multiple stresses increase that some are willing to acknowledge the phenomenon rising living costs are also rapidly dismantling traditional opportunities for socializing not many people can actually afford to visit a pub anymore what was once an affordable source of conviviality for the working classes and the indigent is becoming increasingly expensive what about less expensive or free avenues of socializing i have seen nature treks organized on facebook only to be cancelled due to lack of response traditionally churches and the like offered the ideal avenue for individuals to meet and strike up bonds now traditional values have eroded and too many churches have fallen into disrepute church attendance in the west has also shown a hopeless decline since the post ww2 period some charismatic churches are not cheap to attend either as old testament tithing is enforced dire economic circumstances play a crucial role in the rise of ai relationships dating apps on the other hand can be deceptive borrowing from a familiar computer phrase what you see online is not always what you get while some relationships may emerge from these platforms genuine long term success stories are relatively rare in many cases what initially appears to be compatibility is shaped less by personal connection than by practical considerations such as career prospects social mobility or immigration opportunities when relationships are based on supply and demand rules and steep power gradients imagine the subtle ramifications for subsequent generations within this context how much more fake are ai relationships yes it is unhealthy but what is the true health of normal society today rt now that the scale of the problem has become evident will it get better or worse various ai girlfriend services exist already will they get normalized and become mainstream like sex toys and vr pornography for example will there be therapy sessions and get clean programs like alcoholics anonymous or those for drug or porn addicts mm loneliness will proliferate and so will various forms of digital escapism and parasocial bonds immersive technologies will one day allow individuals to feel the thrill of exploring faraway caves visiting fictitious planets or enjoying sexual intimacy with any character conjured up by an ai prompt this is a slippery slope imagine if you are an explorer in a paleolithic setting and you need to kill in order to survive in that simulation would you transpose this acquired trait to the real world how real will it get what does it feel like being jack the ripper in victorian london will the darknet evolve into the primary marketplace for immersive technologies that exploit primal desires and sexual deviance there will always be therapy sessions for those addicted to various forms of digital addiction but in my opinion the best cure is a supervised camping trip with no modern gizmos allowed rt is this a test for humanity s will to survive as a species mm absolutely this is why our globalists overlords prattle repeatedly over the great reset and the new world order ad nauseum they know that the society they had forged is crumbling at its foundations and they need a new paradigm where the majority of humanity can be safely herded into a digitally curated gulag once inside the denizens may be provided with free immersive technologies along with psychotropic drugs to keep them pliant and pacified that is precisely what yuval noah harari suggested in reference to the future of worthless or useless eaters
