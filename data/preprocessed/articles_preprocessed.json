    "title":"Here are the 20 specific Fox broadcasts and tweets Dominion says were defamatory",
    "body":"For all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.\n\nThe wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\n\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false , saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”\n\nAt trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “ actual malice ” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n\nHere’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n\nThe broadcast : “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote : “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n\n“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote : “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\n\nRelated article What to know ahead of the Fox News and Dominion trial\n\n“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n\n“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n\n“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\n\nThe broadcast : Quote-tweet by Dobbs of Giuliani tweet on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n\n“Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n\nThe broadcast : “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n\n“Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote : “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\n\nThe broadcast : “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote : “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections … We have so much evidence, I feel like it’s coming in through a fire hose,” Powell said.\n\n“Wow,” Bartiromo said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 16, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said.\n\n“Sure,” Dobbs said.\n\nPowell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’”\n\nPowell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 18, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” Dobbs said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 21, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 24, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said.\n\n“I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 30, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote : “Different states shaved different amounts of votes, or the system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states,” Powell said. “Some people were targeted as individual candidates. It’s really the most massive and historical egregious fraud the world has ever seen.”\n\nThe broadcast : “Hannity” on November 30, 2020.\n\nRelated article Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity among prominent Fox hosts, execs set to take stand at defamation trial\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote : “The machine ran an algorithm that shaved votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden,” Powell said. “They used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump. And they used a machine to inject and add massive quantities of votes for Mr. Biden.”\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 4, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote : “Dominion Voting Systems, you have described it with algorithms which were designed to be inaccurate rather than to be a secure system,” Dobbs said.\n\n“Give us your sense of who is driving all of this,” Dobbs asked Phil Waldron, a Trump supporter who worked with Powell and others to spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nThe broadcast : Dobbs tweet with embedded document on December 10, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote : “The 2020 Election is a cyber Pearl Harbor,” Dobbs wrote, embedding a document.\n\n“We have technical presentations that prove there is an embedded controller in every Dominion machine, that allows an election supervisor to move votes from one candidate to another,” the document stated.\n\nThe broadcast : “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on December 10, 2020.\n\nRelated article Fox News reaches settlement with Venezuelan businessman in election defamation case\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote : “Let me make you an offer, very straightforwardly,” Dobbs said. “We will gladly put forward your evidence that supports your claim that this was a Cyber Pearl Harbor. We have tremendous evidence already … of fraud in this election, but I will be glad to put forward on this broadcast whatever evidence you have, and we’ll be glad to do it immediately.”\n\nThe broadcast : Dobbs tweet with embedded video of Powell interview on December 10, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud.\n\nKey false quote : “Cyber Pearl Harbor: @SidneyPowell1 reveals groundbreaking new evidence indicating our Presidential election came under massive cyber-attack orchestrated with the help of Dominion, Smartmatic, and foreign adversaries. #MAGA #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n\nThe broadcast : “Fox & Friends” with hosts Will Cain, Pete Hegseth and Rachel Campos-Duffy on December 12, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud.\n\nKey false quote : “We have a machine, the Dominion machine, that’s as filled with holes as Swiss cheese and was developed to steal elections, and being used in the states that are involved,” Giuliani said.\n\nThe broadcast : “Tucker Carlson Tonight” on January 26, 2021.\n\nWhat they alleged : Election fraud.\n\nKey false quote : “Every outlet in the country, they go, ‘Mike Lindell, there’s no evidence, and he’s making fraudulent statements.’ No. I have the evidence. I dare people to put it on. I dare Dominion to sue me because then it will get out faster. So, this is – you know, they don’t – they don’t want to talk about it,” Lindell said.\n\n“No, they don’t,” Carlson said.",

    "title":"Fox News settles with Dominion at the last second, pays more than $787 million to avert defamation trial over its 2020 election lies",
    "body":"Fox News reached a last-second settlement with Dominion Voting Systems on Tuesday as the case raced toward opening statements, paying more than $787 million to end a colossal two-year legal battle that publicly shredded the right-wing network’s credibility.\n\nFox News’ $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in US history involving a media company.\n\nThe deal was announced hours after the jury was sworn in at the Delaware Superior Court. Rumors of a settlement swirled in the courthouse when, after a lunch break, the proceedings dramatically ground to a halt for nearly three hours with no explanation, while the parties apparently hammered out an accord.\n\n“The parties have resolved their case,” Judge Eric Davis said, before dismissing the 12-member jury, crediting them with giving the parties an impetus to reach a settlement, effusively praising the lawyers from both sides, and gaveling out the so-called media “trial of the century” before it could even begin.\n\nThe groundbreaking settlement “represents vindication and accountability,” Dominion lawyer Justin Nelson said. “For our democracy to endure for another 250 years, and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts… Today represents a ringing endorsement for truth and for democracy.”\n\nThe right-wing network said in a statement that it “acknowledge[s] the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” referring to Davis’ recent ruling that 20 Fox News broadcasts from late 2020 contained blatantly untrue assertions that Dominion rigged the presidential election. But Fox won’t have to admit on-air that it spread lies about Dominion, a Dominion representative told CNN.\n\nThe $787.5 million payout is roughly half of the $1.6 billion that Dominion initially sought , though it is nearly 10 times the company’s valuation from 2018, and roughly eight times its annual revenue in 2021, according to court filings.\n\nThe last-minute agreement means the closely watched case is over and won’t proceed to trial. By settling with Dominion, influential Fox News executives and prominent on-air personalities will be spared from testifying about their 2020 election coverage, which was filled with lies about voter fraud.\n\nThe witness list included Fox Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, his CEO son Lachlan Murdoch, and top Fox hosts like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Damning emails, texts, and deposition testimony made public during the case revealed that these figures, and many others at Fox, privately said in 2020 that the vote-rigging claims against Dominion were asinine. But the lies were spread on-air anyway.\n\nRupert Murdoch thought the election denialism was “really crazy,” even as Fox personalities peddled those same claims to millions of viewers. Carlson said he “passionately” hates Donald Trump , whose presidency was a “disaster.” Fox hosts, producers, fact-checkers, and senior executives privately said in the on-air claims of a stolen election were “kooky,” “dangerously reckless” and  “mind-blowingly nuts.”\n\nThese revelations generated months of blistering headlines for Fox as the case moved toward trial. By settling now, Fox deprived Dominion a chance to further expose its dishonesty with a weeks-long trial.\n\n“This settlement reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards,” Fox said in a statement Tuesday. “We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.”\n\nFox News and Fox Corporation – its parent company, which was also a defendant – maintain they never defamed Dominion, and say the case was a meritless assault on First Amendment press freedoms.\n\nSpeculation of a settlement reached a fever pitch in recent days, especially after the court on Sunday announced a one-day delay to the start of the trial, which was originally set to begin on Monday.\n\nThe jury selection process wrapped up as planned Tuesday morning, and both sides prepped for opening statements. They even briefly tangled over objections to specific slides in their presentations. But when the proceedings didn’t promptly resume after lunch, the chances of a deal seemed to rise by the minute, even though the top lawyers from both sides sat in the courtroom, looking at their phones, and waiting.\n\nThe racially diverse jury of six men and six women was brought back into the court, ready for their front-row seat to a historic trial. But Davis, the judge, instead told the panel they helped spur a settlement.\n\n“Your presence here, short compared to what you thought, and uneventful in a certain sense, was extremely important,” Davis said. “Without you, the parties would not have been able to resolve their situation.”\n\nMany on the Dominion side cast the settlement as a victory for democracy and for truth itself.\n\n“Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees, and the customers that we serve,” Dominion CEO John Poulos said Tuesday outside court.\n\nRelated article Tucker Carlson 'passionately' hates Trump, and eight more key revelations about Fox News from new Dominion filings\n\nWhile the Dominion case is now over, Fox News is still facing a second major defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic , another voting technology company that was similarly smeared on Fox News’ shows after the 2020 election. That case is still in the discovery process, and a trial isn’t expected anytime soon.\n\nFor its part, Dominion still has pending lawsuits against right-wing TV networks Newsmax and OAN, as well as against Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell. They all deny wrongdoing.\n\nCNN’s Liam Reilly and Danny Freeman contributed to this story.",

    "title":"The US economy could depend on McCarthy corralling his extremist Republican troops",
    "body":"Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\n\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\n\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\n\nRelated article Lawmakers return to Washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom\n\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in. It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.\n\nMost countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.\n\nAt least, that’s the way it has worked until now.\n\nMcCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nBut in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.\n\nRep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.\n\n“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”\n\nIt is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”\n\nMcHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit\n\nIn effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.\n\nStill, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.\n\n“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”\n\nRelated article House Republicans in talks over one-year debt ceiling plan in push to challenge White House\n\nHis assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.\n\nBut with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.\n\nSo far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.\n\n“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”\n\nRelated article House GOP escalates defense of Trump with New York field hearing seeking to discredit Manhattan DA\n\nAnother complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\n\nThe coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.\n\nBut are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.\n\nRepublicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.\n\nIn order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.\n\nHe tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.\n\n“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.\n\nPrevious fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.\n\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.\n\nMcCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.\n\nThe White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.\n\n“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.\n\n“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.\n\nMcCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.\n\nAs Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”\n\nCNN’s Melanie Zanona, Morgan Rimmer, Haley Talbot and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

    "summary":"Millions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\n\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\n\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\n\nRelated article Lawmakers return to Washington as debt limit crisis and other key issues loom\n\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in.

    "title":"The White homeowner accused of shooting a Black teen who rang his doorbell turns himself in and is released on bail",
    "body":"The 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.\n\nAndrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\n\nLester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\n\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\n\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\n\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\n\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n\n“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”\n\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n\n“I share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.\n\n“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”\n\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\n\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.\n\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\n\nThe shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.\n\nIt was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”\n\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\n\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\n\nRelated article A 20-year-old woman was shot and killed after accidentally turning into the wrong driveway in upstate New York, officials say\n\nWhile Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.\n\n“ Stand your ground ” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n\nRalph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.\n\n“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”\n\nShe said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n\n“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”\n\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n\n“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.\n\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\n\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\n\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n\n“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.\n\n“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”\n\nThe mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police – including White officers – who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.\n\n“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.\n\n“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”\n\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\n\nHe then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.\n\nLester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.\n\n“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.\n\n“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.\n\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\n\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\n\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\n\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says.  He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.\n\nRelated article How Trayvon Martin's life and death inspired a generation to fight for justice\n\nThe boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.\n\nResponding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lester’s home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.\n\nThe teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states.\n\nA neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.\n\nSince the shooter’s location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety. She said she complied initially, then went outside with towels to help suppress the bleeding.\n\n“This is somebody’s child. I had to clean blood off of my door, off of my railing. That was someone’s child’s blood,” she said. “I’m a mom … this is not OK.”\n\nRalph is still traumatized from the ordeal, but the family hopes for a full recovery because Ralph is young and strong, Crump said.\n\n“He and his family are just happy that he’s alive after being shot in the head,” Crump told CNN.\n\nMerritt said Tuesday the first bullet traveled less than five feet into Yarl’s upper temple and penetrated his skull.\n\n“They scraped bullet fragments off his frontal lobe on Thursday. On Saturday he was home playing with his dog,” Merritt said.\n\nHe said God was telling the community and its leaders they cannot go on as business usual.\n\n“That was in fact a miracle. What are we supposed to learn from that miracle, is the question we need to answer.”\n\nRalph, a section leader in a marching band who could often be found with an instrument in hand, had been looking forward to graduating from high school and visiting West Africa before starting college, according to the GoFundMe page.\n\nRelated article For Black residents of Ahmaud Arbery's hometown, trust in the justice system is on trial right alongside his accused killers\n\n“Life looks a lot different right now. Even though he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. The trauma that he has to endure and survive is unimaginable,” the aunt wrote in the fundraiser.\n\nThe GoFundMe page, started to help the family with medical expenses, had garnered more than $2 million in donations by Monday night.\n\nCrump likened Ralph’s shooting to the shootings of 17-year-old Martin in Florida and 25-year-old Arbery in Georgia.\n\n“We continue to fight to say you can’t profile and shoot our children, just because you have this ‘stand your ground’ law,” Crump said. “Unacceptable.”\n\nMerritt told CNN Monday that the “stand your ground” action would not apply to Ralph’s case.\n\n“The stand your ground action, under the laws of Missouri, are completely inapplicable to this case, because there has been no conversation, not from the suspect, not from the victim and not from law enforcement, that Ralph Yarl, at 16 years old, ever posed a threat to this shooter,” Merritt said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Ralph and his mother, Cleo Nagbe, by phone on Monday evening, a White House official told CNN.\n\nBiden also noted how “fortunate” Ralph is that his mother is not just a nurse, but also a physical therapist.\n\nThe conversation also covered their families, their love of music and Ralph’s dream of pursuing a chemical engineering degree at Texas A&M University – to which Biden “lightheartedly attempted to convince him that (the president’s alma mater) University of Delaware was a much better option,” the official said.\n\n“The president also committed to keeping up his fight against gun violence,” the official said.\n\nCNN’s Arlette Saenz, Steve Almasy, Chris Boyette and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

BENADRYL® products and other diphenhydramine products should only be used as directed by the label.”\n\n“We are working with TikTok and other social platforms to remove content that showcases this behavior,” the statement added. “We will look to partner across industry and with key stakeholders to address this dangerous behavior.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Stevens family and Columbus Public Health for comment.\n\nThe FDA’s 2020 warning said the agency had “contacted TikTok and strongly urged them to remove the videos from their platform and to be vigilant to remove additional videos that may be posted.”\n\nBenadryl is an antihistamine used to treat symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing from upper respiratory allergies, hay fever or the common cold. It’s safe and effective when used as recommended, the FDA said.\n\n“Diphenhydramine is marketed under the brand-name Benadryl, store brands, and generics. It is also available in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and decongestants,” the agency said.\n\nConsumers and parents should store Benadryl and other over-the-counter medications and prescription medicines out of the reach of children, the FDA said.\n\nCNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht and Travis Nichols contributed to this report.",

    "body":"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style . Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nGobbling up too many refined wheat and rice products, along with eating too few whole grains, is fueling the growth of new cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide, according to a new study that models data through 2018.\n\nRelated article Diabetes rates may surge in US young people, study finds\n\n“Our study suggests poor carbohydrate quality is a leading driver of diet-attributable type 2 diabetes globally,” says senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a professor of nutrition at Tufts University and professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston, in a statement.\n\nAnother key factor: People are eating far too much red and processed meats, such as bacon, sausage, salami and the like, the study said. Those three factors — eating too few whole grains and too many processed grains and meats — were the primary drivers of over 14 million new cases of type 2 diabetes in 2018, according to the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nIn fact, the study estimated 7 out of 10 cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide in 2018 were linked to poor food choices.\n\n“These new findings reveal critical areas for national and global focus to improve nutrition and reduce devastating burdens of diabetes,” said Mozaffarian, who is also the editor in chief of the Tufts Health & Nutrition Letter.\n\nMozaffarian and his team developed a research model of dietary intake between 1990 and 2018 and applied it to 184 countries. Compared with 1990, there were 8.6 million more cases of type 2 diabetes due to poor diet in 2018, the study found.\n\nRelated article Blueberries have joined green beans in this year's Dirty Dozen list\n\nResearchers found eating too many unhealthy foods was more of a driver of type 2 diabetes on a global level than a lack of eating wholesome foods, especially for men compared with women, younger compared to older adults, and in urban versus rural residents.\n\nOver 60% of the total global diet-attributable cases of the disease were due to excess intake of just six harmful dietary habits: eating too much refined rice, wheat and potatoes; too many processed and unprocessed red meats; and drinking too many sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice.\n\nInadequate intake of five protective dietary factors — fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and yogurt — was responsible for just over 39% of the new cases.\n\nRelated article Best diet for 2023 is the science-backed Mediterranean style of eating\n\nPeople in Poland and Russia, where diets tend to focus on potatoes and red and processed meat, and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe as well as Central Asia, had the highest percentage of new type 2 diabetes cases linked to diet.\n\nColombia, Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean also had high numbers of new cases, which researchers said could be due to a reliance on sugary drinks and processed meat, as well as a low intake of whole grains.\n\n“Our modeling approach does not prove causation, and our findings should be considered as estimates of risk,” the authors wrote.",

    "title":"ADHD medication abuse in schools is a ‘wake-up call’",
    "body":"At some middle and high schools in the United States, 1 in 4 teens report they’ve abused prescription stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder during the year prior, a new study found.\n\n“This is the first national study to look at the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants by students in middle and high school, and we found a tremendous, wide range of misuse,” said lead author Sean Esteban McCabe, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\n\nRelated article Prescriptions for ADHD treatments surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, CDC report shows\n\n“In some schools there was little to no misuse of stimulants, while in other schools more than 25% of students had used stimulants in nonmedical ways,” said McCabe, who is also a professor of nursing at the University of Michigan School of Nursing. “This study is a major wake-up call.”\n\nNonmedical uses of stimulants can include taking more than a normal dose to get high, or taking the medication with alcohol or other drugs to boost a high, prior studies have found.\n\nStudents also overuse medications or “use a pill that someone gave them due to a sense of stress around academics — they are trying to stay up late and study or finish papers,” said pediatrician Dr. Deepa Camenga, associate director of pediatric programs at the Yale Program in Addiction Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“We know this is happening in colleges. A major takeaway of the new study is that misuse and sharing of stimulant prescription medications is happening in middle and high schools, not just college,” said Camenga, who was not involved with the study.\n\nPublished Tuesday in the journal JAMA Network Open , the study analyzed data collected between 2005 and 2020 by Monitoring the Future, a federal survey that has measured drug and alcohol use among secondary school students nationwide each year since 1975.\n\nIn the data set used for this study, questionnaires were given to more than 230,000 teens in eighth, 10th and 12th grades in a nationally representative sample of 3,284 secondary schools.\n\nRelated article Adderall users struggle with ongoing shortage while reason -- and resolution -- remain uncertain\n\nSchools with the highest rates of teens using prescribed ADHD medications were about 36% more likely to have students misusing prescription stimulants during the past year, the study found. Schools with few to no students currently using such treatments had much less of an issue, but it didn’t disappear, McCabe said.\n\n“We know that the two biggest sources are leftover medications, perhaps from family members such as siblings, and asking peers, who may attend other schools,” he said.\n\nSchools in the suburbs in all regions of the United States except the Northeast had higher rates of teen misuse of ADHD medications, as did schools where typically one or more parent had a college degree, according to the study.\n\nSchools with more White students and those who had medium levels of student binge drinking were also more likely to see teen abuse of stimulants.\n\nOn an individual level, students who said they had used marijuana in the past 30 days were four times as likely to abuse ADHD medications than teens who did not use weed, according to the analysis.\n\nIn addition, adolescents who said they used ADHD medications currently or in the past were about 2.5% more likely to have misused the stimulants when compared with peers who had never used stimulants, the study found.\n\n“But these findings were not being driven solely by teens with ADHD misusing their medications,” McCabe said. “We still found a significant association, even when we excluded students who were never prescribed ADHD therapy.”\n\nData collection for the study was through 2020. Since then, new statistics show prescriptions for stimulants surged 10% during 2021 across most age groups.  At the same time, there has been a nationwide shortage of Adderall, one of the most popular ADHD drugs, leaving many patients unable to fill or refill their prescriptions.\n\nThe stakes are high: Taking stimulant medications improperly over time can result in stimulant use disorder, which can lead to anxiety, depression, psychosis and seizures, experts say.\n\nRelated article The benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts\n\nIf overused or combined with alcohol or other drugs, there can be sudden health consequences. Side effects can include “paranoia, dangerously high body temperatures, and an irregular heartbeat, especially if stimulants are taken in large doses or in ways other than swallowing a pill,” according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration .\n\nResearch has also shown people who misuse ADHD medications are highly likely to have multiple substance use disorders .\n\nAbuse of stimulant drugs has grown over the past two decades, experts say, as more adolescents are diagnosed and prescribed those medications — studies have shown 1 in every 9 high school seniors report taking stimulant therapy for ADHD, McCabe said.\n\nFor children with ADHD who use their medications appropriately, stimulants can be effective treatment. They are “protective for the health of a child,” Camenga said. “Those adolescents diagnosed and treated correctly and monitored do very well — they have a lower risk of new mental health problems or new substance use disorders.”\n\nThe solution to the problem of stimulant misuse among middle and high school teens isn’t to limit use of the medications for the children who really need them, McCabe stressed.\n\n“Instead, we need to look very long and hard at school strategies that are more or less effective in curbing stimulant medication misuse,” he said. “Parents can make sure the schools their kids  attend have safe storage for medication and strict dispensing policies. And ask about prevalence of misuse — that data is available for every school.”\n\nFamilies can also help by talking to their children about how to handle peers who approach them wanting a pill or two to party or pull an all-night study session, he added.\n\n“You’d be surprised how many kids do not know what to say,” McCabe said. “Parents can role-play with their kids to give them options on what to say so they are ready when it happens.”\n\nParents and guardians should always store controlled medications in a lockbox, and should not be afraid to count pills and stay on top of early refills, he added.\n\n“Finally, if parents suspect any type of misuse, they should contact their child’s prescriber right away,” McCabe said. “That child should be screened and assessed immediately.”",

    "title":"Democrats bash Justice Clarence Thomas but their plan to investigate ethics allegations is unclear",
    "body":"Senate Democrats railed against Justice Clarence Thomas on Tuesday amid reports that the Supreme Court conservative failed to disclose luxury travel, gifts and a real estate transaction involving a GOP megadonor, but their plan to investigate the conservative jurist remains unclear.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin has promised that his committee will hold a hearing on the alleged ethics violations in the coming weeks, but shared no details when pressed by CNN on whether lawmakers will seek testimony from Thomas or others who might have knowledge about his relationship with the donor, Texas-based billionaire Harlan Crow.\n\nRelated article Clarence Thomas to amend financial disclosure forms to reflect sale to GOP megadonor\n\nAsked if subpoenas were on the table, Durbin said that no decision has been made on that yet. He said that it was “too soon” to share more information about what his committee’s hearing on Supreme Court ethics might look like. He and other Judiciary Democrats sent a letter to Chief Justice John Roberts last week calling for him to open an investigation into the Thomas allegations.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday that “the American people deserve all of the facts surrounding Justice Thomas’s blatant violation of law.”\n\n“I hope that [Thomas] will voluntarily appear, and if not, we should consider subpoenas for him and others, like Harlan Crow, who have information,” Blumenthal said.\n\nOther Democrats on the committee said Tuesday that they were deferring to Durbin, who huddled with Democrats on Monday evening to discuss their strategy towards Thomas.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans appear mostly united in defending the Thomas, suggesting the court can handle its own affairs.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell attacked Democrats for criticizing the court, and said he has confidence in Roberts “to deal with these court internal issues.”\n\n“The Democrats, it seems to me, spent a lot of time criticizing individual members of the court and going after the court as an institution,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday.\n\nBringing more transparency to the high court has had some bipartisan support in the past, but the court’s jerk to the right – particularly with the three justices that former President Donald Trump put on the bench – has raised the partisan stakes around the issue. In recent years, the conservative majority has handled pivotal rulings undoing abortions rights, dismantling gun regulations and reining in the powers of executive branch agencies – all prompting outcry from Democrats.\n\nEven as Senate Democrats have yet to settle on a plan for their own response to the Thomas allegations, they sought to highlight the issue and framed it within their broader push for a code-of-ethics for the Supreme Court, which is excluded from many of the ethics rules that apply to lower rungs of the federal judiciary.\n\n“I’m disturbed by the recent reports detailing potentially unethical – even potentially illegal conduct – at the highest levels of our judiciary,” Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, said at a Judiciary Committee hearing for three lower court nominees on Tuesday. “It should go without saying that judges at all levels should be held to strict and enforceable ethical standards.”\n\nDurbin said in a speech that Congress shouldn’t have to wait for the court to act.\n\n“The Supreme Court doesn’t need to wait on Congress to clean up its act; the justices could take action today if they wanted to, and if the court fails to act, Congress must,” Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\n\nBack-to back-reports in ProPublica this month detailed how luxury travel and gifts to Thomas from Crow – and even a real estate transaction – went unreported in Thomas’ annual financial disclosures.\n\nThomas has said that the travel and gifts to him and his family that were financed by the Crows went unreported because he had been advised that he was not required to do so, under an exemption in the court’s disclosure rules for so-called “personal hospitality.” After scrutiny of those rules by lawmakers, the Judicial Conference – which operates as the policy-making body for the federal judiciary – recently closed a loophole in those rules that appears to have covered some of the hospitality Thomas received. Thomas said that he intended to follow that updated guidance in the future, and a source close to the justice also told CNN in recent days that he planned to amend his disclosure form to report the real estate transaction, the sale of his mother’s home to Crow.\n\n“If the reports are accurate, it stinks,” Sen. Mitt Romney said Monday evening, in rare comments from a Republican criticizing Thomas’ lack of transparency.\n\nOther Republicans lined up in defense of the justice – who was named to the Supreme Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991 – and said it wasn’t Congress’ place to push an ethics code on the high court.\n\nRelated article GOP revolts against plan to replace Feinstein on key panel in push to block Biden judicial picks\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, suggested that the accusations against Thomas were part of a “multi-decade effort now to target Clarence Thomas by these liberal activist groups.”\n\nThis is not the first time Thomas has been at the center of an ethics controversy. Last year, CNN reported that his wife Ginni Thomas, a conservative activist, was texting with Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about the former president’s efforts overturn his 2020 election defeat, and her political lobbying has long raised questions about when justices are obligated to recuse themselves from cases.\n\nYet Republicans have shown little interest in joining Democrats in using legislation to impose an ethics code on the justices.\n\n“The Court, kind of historically I think, has sort of policed itself,” said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP’s Senate Whip, who said Thomas had been a “solid justice on the court through the years and has acquitted himself well there.”\n\n“Let’s see what the court does,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, told CNN Tuesday. “I prefer them to do it internally.”\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett, Ali Zaslav, Nicky Robertson, Morgan Rimmer and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

    "body":"Our live coverage for the day has ended. Follow the latest Ukraine news here or read through the updates below.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised a framework introduced by China and Brazil, which proposed an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“We applaud the position from China, and we have also held talks with Brazil on this, and these are very useful proposals because they can help to share ideas and help resolve problems,” Lavrov said Tuesday during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela. “All this, however, is not part of the West’s rules.”\n\nLavrov explained the West would not accept the so-called “peace proposal” that would see the Crimean Peninsula fully integrated into the Russian Federation.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly said peace in the conflict will only be achieved if Russia restores the country’s borders and Kyiv takes back Crimea.\n\n“We hope the regime in Kyiv respects the rights of Crimea, we already know the West, it’s demanding that Crimea is returned,” Lavrov said.\n\nSince taking office this year , Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has suggested his country could help broker a negotiation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, arguing Kyiv should relinquish sovereignty claims over Crimea in exchange for the end of the conflict.\n\nLast week, Lula traveled to China and both countries reiterated calls for a peaceful solution to the conflict.\n\nLula has largely adopted a policy of non-intervention over the war in Ukraine, following in the same footsteps of many leaders in middle-income and developing countries.\n\nOn Saturday, Lula said the US and the EU need to start talking about peace between Ukraine and Russia.\n\n“The United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace; the European Union needs to start talking about peace so that we can convince Putin and Zelensky that peace is in the interest of everyone and that war is only interesting, for now, to the two of them,” Lula told reporters in Beijing on Saturday.\n\nSome context: The US and EU have been major suppliers of arms and aid to Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion.\n\nLavrov is in Caracas as part of a five-day trip to Latin America, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. On Tuesday, Lavrov criticized US sanctions on Venezuela and said Russia intends to strengthen diplomatic and commercial relationships with the Andean country.\n\nCNN’s Tatiana Arias and Duarte Mendonca contributed reporting.\n\nAnn Simmons, Wall Street Journal Moscow bureau chief, described detained journalist Evan Gershkovich as a “terrific reporter, largely because he is very familiar with Russian culture and history and tradition.”\n\n“He is from a Russian family, and his parents were Soviet immigrants to the United States. And so, he has got this very intimate view of Russian society,” Simmons told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Tuesday night. “He’s very passionate about Russia and Russians and the story in general. And being able to have that kind of intimate view is so powerful, especially when reporting from Russia,” she said.\n\nSome context: Gershkovich, a US citizen, was arrested in Russia last month on espionage charges. He is currently being held at the notorious Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where he’s expected to remain through at least May 29 and faces up to a 20-year-sentence.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the spying accusations against Gershkovich.\n\nDuring a court hearing Tuesday, Gershkovich was denied an appeal to change the terms of his detention – a ruling the WSJ had expected, Simmons said.\n\n“It was good to see a colleague despite the fact that we saw him in a glass box and in the courtroom essentially detained,” Simmons added.\n\nGershkovich’s attorneys are able to speak with him, and that’s how the newspaper has been gaining insight into his case. Gershkovich is in “good spirits right now,” she said, and has been watching culinary shows on TV while being held.\n\n“We don’t know much more than that,” she said. “Espionage cases are typically classified, and a lot of the information is not revealed.”\n\nA local Russian activist has been arrested after writing he didn’t “feel a shadow of sadness” about the death of Vladlen Tatarsky, a pro-war blogger who was killed in a bombing at an event in a St. Petersburg cafe this month.\n\nRussian law enforcement authorities opened a criminal case against Yaroslav Shirshikov, accusing him of justifying terrorism, according to state news agency TASS.\n\nIn a Telegram post, Shirshikov wrote, in part, to “Tatarsky, who wanted to kill and rob everyone, as he liked, I wish glass wool lining his grave, as well as to those who voluntarily came to the creative evening of this scumbag in St. Petersburg.”\n\nShirshikov was also one of the first people to publicly post on Telegram about Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich’s arrest in Yekaterinburg last month. He told CNN earlier in a phone call that Gershkovich was looking into a number of stories and had texted him to say he was returning to the city. Shirshikov said they met up in Yekaterinburg before Gershkovich was arrested.\n\nCNN has reached out to the WSJ for comment.\n\nThe US will look at “ creative and sometimes quite challenging options ” to try and bring detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich home, but the process could take a long time, a senior administration official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nAt a Tuesday court hearing in Moscow, Gershkovich was denied an appeal to change the terms of his detention.\n\nGershkovich, a US citizen, was arrested in Russia last month. He is being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious Lefortovo prison until at least May 29 and faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the spying accusations against him and the US State Department has officially designated him as wrongfully detained by Russia.\n\nHere are the latest headlines:\n\nPresident Joe Biden extended the ban on Russian-affiliated vessels from US ports. The order, originally published last April, was originally set to expire this week.\n\n“The policies and actions of the Government of the Russian Federation to continue the premeditated, unjustified, unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine continue to constitute a national emergency by reason of a disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations of the United States,” Biden wrote in a letter to Congress. “Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Proclamation 10371.”\n\nFive Shahed drones have been downed in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s president’s office.\n\n“Tonight, our Air Defense Forces performed masterfully in Zaporizhzhia,” Anatolii Kurtev, secretary of Zaporizhzhia City Council, said on Telegram.\n\nThe head of the Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration, Yurii Malashko, said that “enemy ‘tin cans’ have been successfully landed today.”\n\nA Russian man who said he had killed children and other civilians while serving with the Wagner private military company in Ukraine appears to have recanted the claim, suggesting he was blackmailed into making it.\n\nAzamat Uldarov, a former convict, made his retraction in a video call with the Russian news agency RIA-FAN. It’s unclear if there were any conditions to the interview.\n\nHe and another former convict, Alexey Savichev, previously gave long and rambling interviews to Russian human rights group Gulagu.net, saying they were among the tens of thousands of Wagner fighters recruited from Russian jails to fight in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking with Gulagu founder Vladimir Osechkin , Uldarov said he shot and killed a young girl, calling it “a management decision.”\n\n“I wasn’t allowed to let anyone out alive, because my command was to kill anything in my way,” he said, estimating that the girl was five or six years old.\n\nIn his interview with RIA-FAN – which is associated with Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin – Uldarov said he was drunk when he gave the interview, and alleged that Osechkin had blackmailed him about his time in prison.\n\nAsked by RIA-FAN: “They made you say what you said in the video, correct?” Uldarov replied: “Not only correct, it’s [expletive] correct. I had to say it because I had no choice.”\n\n“I said whatever I was told to say,” Uldarov then said.\n\n“Prigozhin is a great guy,” he added, giving a thumbs up. “He saved our lives.”\n\nBut Gulagu’s Osechkin, who is based in France, told CNN he stood by the content of his interviews with the two men, citing Uldarov’s retraction as proof of how quickly dissenting voices are silenced in Russia.\n\nOsechkin also claimed that both interviewees, Uldarov and Savichev, had been threatened with murder if they didn’t retract their statements to him. Savichev told Gulagu that his unit was ordered to kill any men 15 years old or older.\n\nRead more here\n\nThe United States “will look at creative and sometimes quite challenging options” to try to bring home detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich , but the process could take a long time, a senior administration official told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe official declined to provide details on these options and also on whether any proposals have been discussed with Russia.\n\n“Until an American is home, we’re always exploring and re-exploring and re-exploring what the options might be available to bring that American home,” the official added.\n\nIn the past the Russians have wanted legal proceedings – which the US views as “illegitimate” — to play out in court first before they will engage in any serious negotiations, the official said,  and the process may take a long time\n\nOn Tuesday, a Russian court denied Gershkovich’s appeal to serve out his pre-trial detention under house arrest rather than at the notorious Lefortovo Prison. He will be held there until at least May 29 and faces a prison sentence of up to 20 years on espionage charges that the US has strongly condemned.\n\nCalling the lack of regular consular access for Gershkovich “appalling,” the senior administration official said that the US hasn’t heard “specific” concerns about the conditions of the US national’s detention, but said that his detention writ large is “inhumane.”\n\nThe US State Department has officially designated Gershkovich as wrongfully detained by Russia. “I think the starting point for our position on this, including engaging with the Russians, but also for helping the world to understand what’s happened, is that this just should never have been this way in the first place,” the official said, adding that officials are “still figuring out exactly where all of this goes” in terms of negotiations.\n\nLast week, Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said that the Russians have not indicated what they would want in exchange for the release of Gershkovich.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that so far there is no evidence China is providing lethal military aid to Russia.\n\n“We are watching very closely and so far we haven’t seen any evidence that China is providing lethal military aid to Russia,” he told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.\n\n“Our message is very clear: It would be a big mistake to support President [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal war,” he added.\n\nThe relationship between Russia and China: China has claimed neutrality over the war in Ukraine and called for peace in the conflict. But it has also refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or make any public call for Russia to withdraw its troops. The leaders of both countries met in March .\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the head of US forces in the Indo-Pacific warned of the partnership between Russia and China, telling lawmakers it is “pretty concerning.”\n\n“They have no friends,” Adm. John Aquilino, commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the House Armed Services Committee. “They have identified that it is better if they’re together in order to achieve their strategic objectives. That’s a concerning world.”\n\nAquilino added that the relationship ties “directly” the question of misinformation and disinformation.\n\nCNN’s Haley Britzky contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe investigator from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) who led the investigation into American Marine Paul Whelan in Russia is also investigating the case of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich .\n\nFSB investigator Alexei Khizhnyak was named as an investigator for Gershkovich’s case during a hearing at the Moscow City Court on Tuesday.\n\nGershkovich is currently being held in a pre-trial detention center at the notorious Lefortovo prison after he was arrested in late March. His appeal against his detention was denied earlier today and he faces up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges. The Wall Street Journal has vehemently denied the spying accusations against Gershkovich. The US State Department has officially designated the journalist as wrongfully detained by Russia.\n\nWhelan , a former Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.\n\nNATO allies need to give more weapons and supplies to Ukraine, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday.\n\nReferring to the information contained in leaked United States documents that suggests Ukraine may soon run out of air defense ammunition, Stoltenberg said military aid is going to be critical in helping Ukrainians take back positions.\n\n“We recognize the enormous amount of weapons, ammunitions, supplies that have already been provided to Ukraine, but we need to do even more,” Stoltenberg said. “Because we need to ensure that Ukrainians are in a position where they can punch through the Russian lines and also across minefields and be in a position where they can liberate, take back territory,” he added.\n\nSwedish vodka brand Absolut Vodka will once again stop exporting to Russia, a spokesperson for Absolut’s parent company Pernod Ricard confirmed to CNN.\n\nExports of the vodka had been suspended when the war started but Pernod Ricard renewed exports of some of its brands, including Absolut, to Russia at the end of last year, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe decision to do so prompted backlash in Sweden, where Absolut is produced.\n\nAbsolut’s CEO Stephanie Durroux said in a statement on Tuesday that “the reaction over the recent days is clearly reflective of the role Absolut plays for its extended community in Sweden… Therefore, The Absolut Company has decided to stop the export of its brand to Russia.”\n\nDurroux said since March 2022, in compliance with international sanctions and local legal restrictions, “activity in Russia has been strongly reduced and marketing investments have been stopped. By ensuring the economic viability of its distribution subsidiary through limited supply, Pernod Ricard has been able to protect its local team from any local criminal liability, relating to ‘intentional bankruptcy’ in particular.”\n\nShe went on to say the company has a “duty of care towards our employees and partners, we cannot expose them to massive criticism in all forms.”\n\nThe leaked Pentagon documents are not impacting the actions of NATO allies when it comes to Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told CNN Tuesday.\n\n“We have all seen that some of these leakages are incorrect and manipulated,” he said. “I don’t think they will impact what NATO allies are doing when it comes to Ukraine.”\n\nFact check: CNN has reviewed 53 leaked documents, all of which appear to have been produced between mid-February and early March. They contain a wide range of highly classified information – providing a rare window into how the US spies on allies and adversaries alike. Some of the documents, which US officials say are authentic , expose the extent of US eavesdropping on key allies, including South Korea, Israel and Ukraine.\n\nPoland has reached an agreement on restarting the transit of Ukrainian grains through its territory from Friday, according to government officials.\n\n“We will start the passage through Poland of those goods that are on the annex to the regulation from midnight on Friday,” the office of Poland’s prime minister tweeted Friday , quoting Poland’s Minister of Development and Technology Waldemar Buda.\n\n“We will introduce electronic seals and the SENT system for these goods. The regulation will contain a record that will protect us from leaving goods in Poland,” the tweet added.\n\nKyiv is awaiting official communication from the Polish side on the technical aspects of transporting the products, Ukraine’s Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko said.\n\nThe announcement comes following Ukraine-Poland negotiations in Warsaw on Tuesday.\n\n“We treat the problems faced by our Polish colleagues with the same attention Poland treats our problems. Therefore, we must respond promptly and constructively to this crisis situation,” she said, according to a statement released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy.\n\nSome background: Poland banned imports of grain and other food products from Ukraine “to protect the Polish agricultural market against destabilization,” the Polish Prime Minister’s office said in a statement over the weekend.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine it blocked ports and sea routes used to export Ukrainian grain to Africa and the Middle East. In response, the European Union lifted duties on grain from Ukraine to ease distribution to those global markets.\n\nUkrainian grain has since flowed into Poland but much of it has remained in the country, bringing down the price and causing Polish farmers to suffer significant financial losses.\n\nCNN’s Mayria Knight and Jonny Hallam contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is set to discuss the Black Sea grain deal with United Nations Secretary General António Guterres when he visits New York next week, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday citing Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s Permanent Representative to the UN.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine accused Moscow of threatening the UN-brokered grain deal — which aims to ease a global food crisis sparked by the war — and said that the inspections of ships in Turkish territorial waters were blocked for the second time. Russian state news agency RIA reported inspections under the grain deal had resumed on Tuesday, citing Pyotr Ilyichev, director of the department for international organizations at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nLavrov’s trip to New York was made possible after Russian Ambassador to US, Anatoly Antonov, urged Washington last week to issue a permit for the foreign minister’s special aircraft and visas for the Russian delegation to chair the UN Security Council meeting in New York.\n\nIn response, a State Department spokesperson said last week that as a host country of the UN, the United States takes its obligations under the UN Headquarters Agreement seriously, “including with respect to visa issuance.”\n\nThe agreement states, “the federal, state or local authorities of the United States shall not impose any impediments to transit to or from the headquarters district of: (1) representatives of Members or officials of the United Nations, or of specialized agencies as defined in Article 57, paragraph 2, of the Charter, or the families of such representatives or officials.”\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry has summoned the US, Canadian and UK ambassadors “in connection with gross interference in the affairs of the Russian Federation and activities that do not correspond to diplomatic status,” the ministry said as quoted by state-owned news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nVideo shows US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy arriving to the foreign ministry and departing about an hour later.\n\nWhat the ministry told US diplomat: The ministry issued a “strong protest” to Tracy on Tuesday for statements of support for jailed Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza .\n\nIn a statement, the ministry also accused the US envoy of violating the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and threatened to end her stay in Moscow ahead of schedule if she abused her status.\n\n“It was especially noted that any steps by the American side aimed at inciting discord and enmity in Russian society, as well as using the diplomatic mission to cover up subversive work, will be severely suppressed,” the ministry said.",

    "title":"Wrestling Over Charlie Kirk’s Legacy and the Divide in America",
    "body":"On the night in April 1968 that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, then a candidate for president, told a shocked and largely Black crowd in Indianapolis that “it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.”\n\n“Those of you who are Black,” he said, could be filled with “a desire for revenge.” Or, he said, the nation could try to replace violence “with an effort to understand.” It was considered one of the finest speeches of his life. But in the wake of Dr. King’s death, riots, looting and arson erupted in more than 100 American cities, and Kennedy himself was assassinated that June in California.\n\nFifty-seven years later, the nation is at another polarized moment after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist gunned down on a college campus in Utah. Beyond an ability to inspire passion in others, Dr. King and Mr. Kirk had almost nothing in common. But their murders both occurred in a country already awash in violent political rhetoric and partisan anger.\n\nAmericans are now grappling with the brutal killing of a young leader who is viewed through radically different lenses. On the right, Mr. Kirk has been lionized as an inspiration to a new generation of Republicans. On the left, he has been pilloried as a divider who attacked civil rights, transgender rights, feminism and Islam.\n\nAs people wrestle over Mr. Kirk’s legacy, historians and scholars say the lessons of this particular time will depend on Americans themselves. It is another test, they say, of the American experiment.\n\n“Does a reprehensible crime against a political figure lead to more reprehensible acts, or does it remind us that we have to be able to live with people whose opinions we despise without resorting to violence?” asked the presidential biographer Jon Meacham. “If this is open season on everybody who expresses an opinion, then the American covenant is broken.”\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Mr. Kirk’s murder, anger has pulsed loudly. President Trump blamed the left for what he said was savage rhetoric that had led to Mr. Kirk’s death and vowed to go after “those who contributed to this atrocity.” Democrats and Republicans in Congress lashed out at each other and are ever more fearful for their own safety. People who castigated Mr. Kirk and his views have been targeted and exposed by right-wing influencers. Mentions of the term “civil war” skyrocketed on social media platforms.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, has stood out for trying to turn down the heat. “This is certainly about the tragic death, assassination, political assassination, of Charlie Kirk,” he said at a news conference on Friday. “But it is also much bigger than an attack on an individual. It is an attack on all of us.” Mr. Kirk, he said, championed free speech, and “in having his life taken in that very act makes it more difficult for people to feel like they can share their ideas, that they can speak freely.”\n\nMr. Kirk did speak freely. He called Dr. King “awful” and “not a good person.” He described the Civil Rights Act as a “huge mistake” and George Floyd as a “ scumbag .” He said that Islam “is not compatible with Western civilization,” and accused “Jewish donors” of fueling radicalism by financing “not just colleges — it’s the nonprofits, it’s the movies, it’s Hollywood, it’s all of it.” Democratic women, he said, “want to die alone without children.”\n\nBut among thousands of young conservatives on American college campuses he was a rock star, a gifted speaker who relished debating with more liberal students. At the 2024 Republican convention, he reached out directly to his generation. “Democrats have given hundreds of billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations, while Gen Z has to pinch pennies just so that they can never own a home, never marry, and work until they die, childless,” he said.\n\nTo Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s first campaign manager in 2020, Mr. Kirk “loved America and was truly remarkable.” Mr. Parscale recalled that Mr. Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, the nation’s pre-eminent right-wing youth activist group, had come to him in 2018 to offer his help for the campaign. “But I told him, ‘Go do your own thing and you’ll help the president 100 times more. The campaign will hold you back. You’re bigger than this.’ And he was,” Mr. Parscale said.\n\nTo Dan T. Carter, the author of “The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism and the Transformation of American Politics,” Mr. Kirk was a dark force. His assassination, he said, “is a terrible thing for America, but I don’t think we gain anything by embracing him as some kind of open-minded individual who strengthened democracy.”\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, who angered Mr. Trump when she asked him the day after his second inauguration to “have mercy” on immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people, said rage from those anguished over Mr. Kirk’s death was to be expected.\n\n“Public grief is necessary and this is a time for those who loved and admired Charlie Kirk to grieve and to grieve publicly,” she said. “For those who were hurt or aggrieved by his positions, I think this is a time for us to be gracious, and allow grief to be expressed. And at the same time, not to be surprised that other emotions are also communicated.”\n\nWhen someone dies, she said, “we try to focus on the good, to the point that some people say, ‘I don’t recognize the man who is being eulogized.’ But I hear that from a son speaking about his father. I’ve been in those rooms. If that happens in family life, why would we be surprised if it happens in our national life with a public figure? Can’t we be gracious about that too?”\n\nDannagal Goldthwaite Young, a professor of communications at the University of Delaware who researches media psychology and public opinion, said she had noticed a restraint in mainstream media reporting about Mr. Kirk’s death.\n\n“I think there is a recognition that this moment is so important, and this country is such a tinderbox, that people who are in media and journalism, especially those on the left, are aware that they have a responsibility to take the temperature down. And I think that’s a very good thing in terms of democratic health.”\n\nBut she said she thought some things had gotten lost, notably that people who praised Mr. Kirk for civility were confusing the term with politeness. “Charlie Kirk was polite, which is about your mode of discourse,” she said. In her opinion, he was not civil because, she said, he excluded certain groups from the public sphere.\n\nDespite the vitriol of the moment, Professor Young said she was an optimist, thanks in part to what she has learned from public opinion research. “I know what people really want. Americans are sickened by these moments. By and large, Americans reject political violence.”\n\nOn Friday, after announcing the arrest of the man suspected of killing Mr. Kirk, Mr. Cox made an appeal to young people. Some of them loved the young activist, he said, and some of them hated him.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Kirk would say, “Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much,” the governor recalled.\n\n“To my young friends out there, you are inheriting a country where politics feels like rage,” Mr. Cox said. “It feels like rage is the only option, but, through those words, we have a reminder that we can choose a different path.”\n\n“Your generation,” he added, “has an opportunity to build a culture that is very different than what we are suffering through right now.”\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.",

    "title":"After Charlie Kirk Killing, Suspect Joked That His ‘Doppelganger’ Did It",
    "body":"The day after Charlie Kirk was killed, an acquaintance of Tyler Robinson’s posed a question to him in a group chat.\n\nThe F.B.I. had just released two grainy surveillance images of a skinny young man in a cap and sunglasses walking in a stairwell on the Utah Valley University campus, and had asked for the public’s help in identifying the suspect.\n\nTagging Mr. Robinson’s username on Discord, a messaging platform, the acquaintance attached the images and wrote “wya” — where you at? — with a skull emoji, suggesting that Mr. Robinson, 22, looked like the man being sought.\n\nMr. Robinson replied within a minute. His “doppelganger,” he wrote, was trying to “get me in trouble.”\n\n“Tyler killed Charlie!!!!” another user wrote, apparently in jest.\n\nThat was on Thursday afternoon, around 1 p.m. local time. It was not until later that night, nearly 34 hours after the shooting, that Mr. Robinson was arrested on suspicion of carrying out the assassination of Mr. Kirk, 31, a conservative pundit whose killing has inflamed the political world.\n\nThe Discord messages were the clearest glimpse yet of the suspect’s demeanor in the hours after the killing. They were shared with The New York Times by someone who knew Mr. Robinson in high school and has kept up with him in the group chat — which includes about 20 people — but said he had not seen Mr. Robinson in person for several years. He spoke on the condition that his name not be used, fearing harassment for being an acquaintance of the suspect.\n\nThe Times independently verified that the person who shared the screenshots attended high school with Mr. Robinson, and found other indications that they knew one another. The screenshots were shared at the request of The Times. Discord declined to confirm Mr. Robinson’s username, but it matches several other accounts that he used elsewhere online.\n\nThe suspect is expected to be formally charged by local prosecutors on Tuesday. It was not clear on Saturday if he had a lawyer.\n\nThe messages do not shed light on a possible motivation for the shooting, which has been fiercely debated by people trying to ascribe blame to a political side. A police officer wrote in an affidavit that Mr. Robinson had recently discussed Mr. Kirk’s upcoming event in Utah with a family member, and that the two had “talked about why they didn’t like him.”\n\nPeople who knew Mr. Robinson over the years said that he was extremely intelligent, followed current events, and spent much of his time online or playing video games. He was registered to vote but was not affiliated with a political party and appeared to have never voted in an election; his parents are both registered Republicans.\n\nAfter Mr. Robinson joked that the gunman was his look-alike, another user suggested that the group could turn Mr. Robinson in and get the $100,000 reward that the F.B.I. was offering.\n\n“Only if I get a cut,” Mr. Robinson responded.\n\nSomeone posted, “Whatever you do, don’t go to a mcdonalds anytime soon,” a reference to the arrest of Luigi Mangione, who was found at a McDonald’s restaurant and charged with the killing of a health insurance chief executive in Manhattan.\n\nMr. Robinson agreed and offered a supposed joke of his own, writing “better also get rid of this manifesto and exact copy rifle I have lying around.”\n\nWhen another user suggested that the killing of Mr. Kirk would lead President Trump to send the National Guard to Utah, the suspect replied, “in a red state??? nah CLEARLY the shooter was from california.”\n\nAround that time, several news outlets reported that ammunition found near a rifle at the scene included engravings referencing “transgender ideology.” The truth, ultimately, was that the engravings included the phrase “hey fascist! CATCH!” as well as lyrics from an antifascist Italian folk song and a reference to a sexual meme about a “bulge.”\n\nBut at the time, before the exact phrasing of the engravings was publicly known, the suspect sent messages that suggested he was closely following the news.\n\n“I heard the ammo had somethin about trans stuff on it, but they aren’t releasing photos or exact quotes,” he wrote. He added: “and also the claim wasn’t backed by the official fbi, just some dude in the briefing room.”\n\nA few minutes later, he joked: “I’m actually Charlie Kirk, wanted to get outta politics so I faked my death, now I can live out my dream life in kansas.”\n\nMr. Robinson’s messages on Discord appeared next to his avatar, which was from a Garfield comic and depicted the confused face of Garfield’s owner, Jon Arbuckle.\n\nThe police have said that the suspect walked onto campus ahead of the event, in which Mr. Kirk debated students with opposing beliefs, and climbed up to the roof of a building about 400 feet away from where Mr. Kirk was speaking. The gunman fired one shot, they said, fatally striking Mr. Kirk, and then dropped down from the roof and rushed off campus.\n\nThe police said that Mr. Robinson had implied or confessed that he committed the crime, and that he was then encouraged by a family member and family friend to turn himself in, which he did. He surrendered to the police in Southwestern Utah, where he lived, more than a three hours’ drive from the campus where the shooting took place.\n\nFollowing the suspect’s arrest on Thursday night, members of the group chat on Discord struggled to believe that he was actually being accused of the crime. “Our governor wants to give him the death penalty dude,” one wrote.\n\nAnother said: “I truly cannot distinguish if this is for real.”\n\nAric Toler contributed reporting.

    "title":"Erika Kirk, Charlie Kirk’s Widow, Grieves Publicly, Melding Personal and Political",
    "body":"A rosary thrust out the tinted window of a car. Hands resting on a casket.\n\nThe images of Erika Kirk in the days since her husband, Charlie Kirk, was assassinated have been wrenching. Though Ms. Kirk has now lurched into a new and harrowing spotlight as she grieves in public, for four years she has stood on convention stages alongside Mr. Kirk and built her own following of young conservative admirers, while helping her husband build his.\n\n“You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife,” Ms. Kirk said, standing in a white blazer at a lectern at Turning Point USA headquarters on Friday, in her first public speech since her husband, a right-wing force and key ally to President Trump, was killed at a college event in Utah. “The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry.”\n\nMs. Kirk also shared images on Instagram, where she has more than four million followers, of her hands folded together with Mr. Kirk’s in his coffin and herself embracing Vice President JD Vance with his wife, Usha Vance — braiding the personal and the political, the vulnerable and the operational, as she finds herself a widow on a national stage.\n\n“If they thought my husband’s mission was big now,” she wrote, “you have no idea.”\n\nThis is the blueprint that she and Mr. Kirk created together since marrying in 2021. The public image of their marriage deeply appealed to young people in the right-wing movement they were building, drawing in those who wanted the family life they put on display.\n\nMr. Kirk’s politics and worldview were inextricably wound together with his personal life, and his marriage was a core part of his public reputation. And Ms. Kirk, 36, a former Miss Arizona winner and entrepreneur who made biblical streetwear, played a critical role in projecting that image.\n\nShe left many political topics to her husband, who was known for views that were anti-immigrant, anti-civil rights and anti-Islam.\n\nBut she also boosted his inflammatory rhetoric on transgender people, gay marriage and other issues, and made her own condemning statements about the political left. “The spiritual battle — I know you guys feel it. It’s so deep in the soul. You can walk into a room and feel the enemy,” she told a Turning Point crowd recently.\n\nJust three months ago, at a hotel convention center in Dallas, Mr. and Ms. Kirk jointly headlined the Young Women’s Leadership Summit, the largest gathering of young conservative women in the country, a Turning Point USA event. When Ms. Kirk took the stage opening night, before an audience of 3,000, she emerged in a rose pink dress and a puff of pink smoke. Audience members applauded and raced to snap videos as Ms. Kirk talked about marriage and motherhood, while criticizing left-wing perspectives on both.\n\n“Before I met Charlie, I was not on the path of ‘I want to have six kids, and a white picket house fence’ — that was not my mind-set,” she told the room. “But this is how amazing God is. When you meet the right man, everything shifts. When I met Charlie, that was it. I could care less about a career.” This last point elicited an ecstatic cheer from an audience member.\n\nWhen Mr. Kirk joined his wife onstage — “How great is Erika, by the way?” — the room burst into more applause. College-aged women in the audience put their hands over their hearts and broke into a chorus of side conversations about how enviable their marriage seemed. “I really enjoyed that conversation about marriage and relationships,” said Ella Guidry, 22.\n\nMr. Kirk told the room that they would answer questions but avoid politics for the night — though it was a crowd largely receptive to even his inflammatory comments, whether about immigration or race. Instead, they wanted to talk about their relationship and raising children — “the fun stuff,” Mr. Kirk said.\n\nThe two discussed making time for date nights despite Mr. Kirk’s travel schedule and observing the Sabbath every weekend to have time to read the Bible.\n\nTogether, the couple presented a unified message to the room: Get married early, have children. “You’re not wasting a degree when you’re raising your children with wisdom, love and truth,” Ms. Kirk advised. “I don’t want you to chase a paycheck.”\n\nMr. Kirk was the more emphatic foil to his wife, the two of them beaming playfully at each another while she softened his messaging. “Young ladies need to be willing to submit to a godly man when you met one,” Mr. Kirk said. “The hyper-toxic feminism is very off-putting to young men.”\n\n“For the women who are getting married after 30, that’s OK,” Ms. Kirk said. “I’m trying to bridge the gap here. Because it is OK. It’s not ideal. It’s not probably the best statistical odd position for you. But God is good.”\n\nMany Turning Point members had long wanted to emulate the seemingly glamorous model that they saw in watching him and Ms. Kirk. “I like how they talked about how you can have everything, just not at the same time,” said Kieran Cunningham, 27, who came to the Dallas conference from Bedford, Texas.\n\nTo some young women at the Turning Point USA women’s event, Ms. Kirk represented contradictions that they see woven broadly into right-wing messaging about family and professional life. She was a successful entrepreneur, but urged her followers to put motherhood before career; she was a public face for a movement, but advised sublimating ambition to faith and family.\n\nThis emphasis on submission seemed at odds with Ms. Kirk’s high-profile public reputation to some of her followers. As the high school student Nicole Hadar put it: “There was a lot of talk from Erika about being submissive toward your husband — I do want to be married one day, but I also want to pursue a career.”\n\nFor others, it was a comfort that Ms. Kirk didn’t seem torn between the two. “Erika does have her own business,” the Turning Point attendee Ms. Cunningham noted.\n\nAnd after all, Ms. Kirk has company in the large and fast-growing coterie of conservative women — from Phyllis Schlafly to the wellness influencer Alex Clark — whose careers are spent urging women to be dubious of certain feminist messaging about women’s ambitions for public life.\n\nThat Ms. Kirk embraced a public role in her husband’s movement is unsurprising given the story of their union. Mr. Kirk messaged her on Instagram in 2018 wanting to meet. They went to dinner at a Bill’s Bar and Burger, in Manhattan, and Ms. Kirk thought she might be interviewing for a job at Turning Point USA.\n\nFifteen minutes into dinner, Mr. Kirk said, he “pivoted from wanting to hire her to wanting to date her.” (“You should absolutely interview for your spouse,” Mr. Kirk advised at a Turning Point conference a year ago.) They got married in 2021 in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nIn her speech on Friday, two days after Mr. Kirk’s death, Ms. Kirk pledged to take on the mantle of her husband’s work. She discussed the pain of figuring out what to tell their two children and reflected on the force of their faith and the strength of their marriage, all while promising that the Turning Point USA campus tour would continue and that the group’s large December gathering would go forward as planned.\n\n“To everyone listening right now across America, the movement my husband built will not die,” Ms. Kirk said. “It won’t. I refuse to let that happen.”",

    "title":"Trump Escalates Attacks on Political Opponents After Charlie Kirk’s Killing",
    "body":"President Trump and his top advisers are escalating their attacks on their opponents in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing, placing the blame for political violence on Democrats alone and signaling a broad crackdown on critics and left-leaning institutions.\n\nMr. Trump blamed the “radical left” almost immediately after Mr. Kirk was shot, before the authorities had identified a suspect. He promised to find those responsible for political violence, as well as the “organizations that fund it and support it.”\n\nMr. Trump has an expansive view of those he deems radical, applying that term to almost all of his political adversaries. In his second term, Mr. Trump has pushed the boundaries of his authority to exact retribution on political opponents and institutions.\n\nThe death of Mr. Kirk, a popular young conservative activist, has added fuel to Mr. Trump’s campaign against his opponents. He and his administration have promised to bring the killer to justice while using the moment to blame the left — and only the left — more broadly.\n\nCritics of the administration now worry that Mr. Kirk’s murder could be used as a pretext to move even more aggressively against those who speak out against Mr. Trump.\n\nThe authorities were still working to discern a motive in the killing on Saturday morning. The suspect had recently spoken with a family member about the fact that Mr. Kirk was going to hold an event in Utah, according to a police affidavit, and he and his relative discussed “why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints he had.”\n\nAmerica in recent years has seen a wave of violence across the political spectrum , targeting Democrats and Republicans, but Mr. Trump has focused only on attacks against conservatives and his allies. On Friday, he appeared to excuse right-wing radicals by arguing they were motivated by a desire to reduce crime.\n\nAnd while the president has provided few specifics about how he plans to address rising political violence or mete out punishments, several administration officials vowed to scrutinize speech by those who have denounced Mr. Kirk — a self-declared supporter of free speech — and his often inflammatory views .\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that his agency was closely tracking any military personnel who celebrated or mocked Mr. Kirk’s death, and Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, suggested the administration would strip visas from individuals who celebrated Mr. Kirk’s death.\n\n“I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Mr. Landau wrote on X.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Representative Clay Higgins, Republican of Louisiana, said he would use his congressional authority to seek immediate bans for life from social media platforms for anyone who “belittled the assassination of Charlie Kirk.”\n\n“I’m also going after their business licenses and permitting, their businesses will be blacklisted aggressively, they should be kicked from every school, and their drivers licenses should be revoked,” he wrote on X. “I’m basically going to cancel with extreme prejudice these evil, sick animals who celebrated Charlie Kirk’s assassination. I’m starting that today.”\n\nMr. Trump also renewed his call on Friday for prosecutors to file racketeering charges against George Soros, one of the Democratic Party’s biggest donors. Mr. Trump and his allies have long claimed without evidence that Mr. Soros foments violent protests.\n\n“We’re going to look into Soros because I think it’s a RICO case against him and other people because this is more than protests,” he said on Fox News. “This is real agitation; this is riots on the street — and we’re going to look into that.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Soros’s organization, Open Society Foundations, denied the allegations and called the threats “outrageous.”\n\nStephen Miller, a top adviser to the president, characterized the current moment in America as a battle between “family and nature” and those who celebrate “everything that is warped, twisted and depraved.”\n\nHe said the “fate of millions depends upon the defeat of this wicked ideology.”\n\nIn an interview on Thursday with Scott Jennings, a conservative radio host, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, said that before Mr. Kirk’s death, the administration had been working on “a more comprehensive plan on violence in America, the importance of free speech and civil speech,” though she did not provide any details. White House officials also declined to answer questions about the plan.\n\nExperts warn that the polarization in the country is growing increasingly dire.\n\n“We’re watching grief, anger, blame and calls for retribution all occurring in parallel and all occurring in the public sphere,” said Sean Westwood, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the director of the Polarization Research Lab.\n\nHe added: “In that kind of environment, the loudest voice is going to prevail, and in the moment, that loudest voice is calling for further division. So unlike the past, where we’ve had leaders pushing us together, we now have leaders who are pushing us apart, and that could lead to more violence.”\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, took a strikingly different approach during the news conference where officials announced the arrest of a suspect on Friday. Mr. Cox asked for people to lower the political temperature and stay off social media.\n\n“We can return violence with violence, we can return hate with hate, and that’s the problem with political violence — is it metastasizes,” he said. “Because we can always point the finger at the other side. And at some point, we have to find an off-ramp, or it’s going to get much, much worse.”\n\nLiberal organizations fear that the Trump administration will use the shooting to justify a crackdown on their operations, targeting their cash flow, nonprofit status or contributors.\n\nJess O’Connell, a political strategist who co-founded the Democracy Security Project, said left-leaning civil and nonprofit organizations had been grappling with heightened security threats since Mr. Trump took office. But the president’s explicit calls to crack down on left-wing activists have dramatically escalated those fears, she said.\n\n“The president has been looking for anything he can use to justify a big crackdown on his perceived political enemies that includes not just nonprofits but civic and cultural organizations,” she said. “It’s a danger to all of us when the president picks sides on who we should mourn.”\n\nSean Kennedy, a conservative activist who researches left-wing donors at the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said some scrutiny of liberal money was justified after Mr. Kirk’s shooting — but not all.\n\n“Trump is right to investigate and prosecute left-wing purveyors of political violence,” he said. Still, he added, that “however abhorrent their ideas may be, George Soros isn’t Al Capone and the A.C.L.U. isn’t antifa.”\n\nIn Utah on Thursday, officials arrested a 22-year-old man, Tyler Robinson, in connection with Mr. Kirk’s killing. Investigators said they had found messages inscribed on unfired cartridges in the woods near campus, alongside the rifle that had been used in the attack. The messages, they said, suggested familiarity with antifascist symbolism and the irreverent slang of internet memes and role-play communities.\n\nMissing from Mr. Trump’s denunciations of his opponents after Mr. Kirk’s death is any mention of political violence that has targeted Democrats.\n\nMelissa Hortman, the former Democratic speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, was killed in June; Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania was the victim of an arson attack on his home in April while he and his family slept; Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently beaten inside his home in 2022 by an intruder who was targeting Ms. Pelosi; and 13 men were arrested in 2020 for plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.\n\nAnd Mr. Kirk was far from the first prominent Republican targeted: Mr. Trump survived two assassination attempts during the presidential campaign, and in 2017, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, was injured in a shooting.\n\nAfter Mr. Kirk was killed, Mr. Trump ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff and said he would award Mr. Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor.\n\nShane Goldmacher , Lisa Lerer and Theodore Schleifer contributed reporting.",

    "title":"In Some Records, Fed Governor Lisa Cook Listed Atlanta Home as Secondary",
    "body":"President Trump has sought to oust Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve on grounds that she committed mortgage fraud, by falsifying crucial records to obtain more favorable terms on a home loan.\n\nBut new documents call that narrative into question.\n\nA loan record reviewed by The New York Times suggests that Ms. Cook did not try to deceive lenders about one of the properties, a home in Atlanta, that she purchased before joining the nation’s central bank in 2022.\n\nThat document, as well as another submitted as part of Ms. Cook’s nomination process, complicates Mr. Trump’s attempts to remove Ms. Cook, days after the government asked a federal court to block her from participating in the Fed’s meeting this coming week, where the central bank is expected to lower interest rates.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, lawyers for Ms. Cook referenced the newly unearthed documents in urging a panel of judges to allow her to continue serving. They also warned that Mr. Trump’s actions could cause financial havoc and undermine confidence in the central bank.\n\n“This should be case closed on the Cook mortgage issue,” said Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law. “There is no way to maintain a criminal prosecution in light of the disclosure in Cook’s loan application.”\n\nMs. Cook bought the property, a condominium in Atlanta, in 2021. The president and his top aides have accused Ms. Cook of incorrectly claiming both the condo and another property in Michigan, purchased weeks earlier, as her primary residence, seemingly in a bid to secure a lower interest rate on a mortgage.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides contend that this represents fraud, though Ms. Cook has not been charged with any wrongdoing or convicted of a crime. But a set of financial records reviewed by the Times — a preliminary loan estimate from a credit union dated May 2021 — offers a possible competing view.\n\nThe documents instead classify that Atlanta residence as a “vacation home.” Similar language appears in a second set of records, furnished later that year to the government ahead of Ms. Cook’s confirmation to the Fed. In those heavily redacted submissions, the Atlanta condo is described as a “2nd home.”\n\nKathleen C. Engel, an expert on mortgage fraud at Suffolk University’s law school, said that, in order to prove fraud, prosecutors would need to establish that Ms. Cook misled her lender about her intended use of the property.\n\n“The fraud allegation is dramatically weakened by the evidence that this was on her application,” Ms. Engel said. “She was candid about how she was using the property.”\n\nShe added: “It actually rebuts any inference that she engaged in fraud.”\n\nMs. Cook has said little about her own finances even after Mr. Trump took the extraordinary step last month of trying to fire her. Mr. Trump’s actions have touched off a landmark legal battle, which could see him expand his power to dismiss members of the central bank, potentially eroding its independence from political interference.\n\nThe disclosures do not appear to be legal documents, and they do not prove that Ms. Cook was transparent about her intended use of the property throughout the loan application process. But they do suggest that she may have told her lender about her plans at least once.Lawyers for Ms. Cook declined to comment on the disclosures, which were first reported by Reuters. But they referenced a news story about the records in their Saturday filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that Ms. Cook had been “deprived of a forum in which to offer any evidence” in her defense.\n\nThe new revelations did not appear to satisfy Ms. Cook’s critics in the Trump administration. The man at the forefront of her ouster — Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who first broadcast allegations of fraud — signaled earlier Saturday that the newly released records did not absolve Ms. Cook of wrongdoing.\n\n“Dr. Cook represents herself as an extremely accomplished financial operator,” Mr. Pulte said in a post on social media. “If Dr. Cook solicited estimates as a vacation home and then entered into a mortgage agreement as a primary residence, that is extremely concerning, and in my opinion, evidences further intent to defraud.”\n\nMr. Pulte previously referred the matter to the Justice Department, which has opened a criminal investigation into Ms. Cook. He said in a second post on social media this weekend: “The idea that she got estimates and then declared it as a primary on her mortgage agreement is even more concerning for Dr. Cook.”\n\nBut Ms. Engel said Mr. Pulte was misunderstanding or misrepresenting the mortgage application process. As long as Ms. Cook disclosed her plans to use the home as a secondary home to her lender, there is no fraud, she said. Ms. Engel said she would not necessarily expect publicly available loan documents to show an acknowledgment from her lender that the property would be used as a second home.\n\n“Pulte would know this, or would have access to people who would know this at F.H.F.A.,” she said.\n\nThe new evidence arrived as the Trump administration forged ahead with its attempts to block Ms. Cook from attending a pivotal Fed meeting this coming week, at which the central bank is expected to lower interest rates. The government filed its emergency request with an appeals court on Thursday, seeking to reverse an earlier decision by a lower court, which had blocked the president from firing Ms. Cook.\n\nThe lower court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had failed to identify sufficient cause for dismissing Ms. Cook under the Federal Reserve Act, finding that it had to involve behavior while she served as a governor and relate to the job itself. Ms. Cook’s lawyers have argued that any attempt to prevent her from attending the upcoming Fed meeting could rattle financial markets.\n\nMs. Cook’s counsel repeated those warnings on Saturday. They told the appellate judges that removing Ms. Cook would send a “destabilizing signal to the financial markets that could not be easily undone.”\n\nThey also said the government’s request risked undermining the Fed, threatening an “immediate end” to its history of political independence, while opening the door for Mr. Trump to fire other members of the central bank for political reasons.\n\n“Nothing would then stop the President from firing other members of the Board on similarly flimsy pretexts,” Ms. Cook’s lawyers said. “The era of Fed independence would be over.”\n\nThe appeals court has given the Trump administration until 3 p.m. on Sunday to respond to Ms. Cook’s legal filing.\n\nKate Kelly contributed reporting.",

    "title":"NPR and PBS Must Transform After Trump’s Cuts Cripple Broadcasters",
    "body":"On the windswept prairie of South Dakota, a tribal public radio station is selling off its old records to pay the bills. In Warm Springs, Ore., the NPR affiliate is considering dropping “All Things Considered” to focus on tribal issues.\n\nIn Bunker Hill, Kan., (population 103), the public TV station may eventually have to cut ties with PBS, pulling children’s shows like “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.”\n\n“We are crippled here,” said Betsy Schwien, the general manager of Smoky Hills PBS in Bunker Hill. “It is the absolute worst-case scenario.”\n\nThe decision by President Trump and Republicans in Congress to strip $500 million from public broadcasters this summer is forcing profound changes that will reshape the airwaves, especially in rural and tribal areas of the country.\n\nSome stations are beginning to go off the air, as Congress was warned before it went ahead and eliminated funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , the taxpayer-backed company that supports public media, ultimately shutting it down. But short of that, no station will be immune from impacts.\n\nNPR and PBS, aware of the strain, have lowered fees for impacted stations. But for many, that’s not enough. Some are considering dropping nationally produced shows from NPR and PBS amid enormous budget shortfalls. Florida Public Media, an association of 24 NPR and PBS stations, last month sent a letter to NPR’s chief executive, Katherine Maher, pleading for lower program fees.\n\n“Simply put, the fee relief plan NPR has proposed is not sufficient to keep many NPR programs on the air in much of Florida,” the stations wrote. (In some states, like Florida, state funding has also been cut.)\n\nSome are turning to grants and emergency membership drives and considering higher fees on corporate sponsors to stanch the bleeding.\n\nOthers, fielding complaints from their members, are voicing worries about the political balance in news coverage, a delicate issue for station directors in red states. Republicans have long complained about what they call a liberal bias in public broadcasting, but if rural NPR affiliates shed national shows like “All Things Considered” and “Morning Edition,” the airwaves would give listeners few alternatives to conservative talk radio in many areas.\n\nFor most Americans, public radio and television won’t disappear. NPR and PBS aren’t going away, and many stations in the biggest cities will withstand the cuts. But the sudden loss of government support is transforming a cultural touchstone that has endured for more than a half-century.\n\n“Public media leaders will need to be more open to ideas that might have been discarded in the past,” said Steve Bass, a public media consultant.\n\nNext year will mark the 40th year since KWSO (91.9 FM) , a public radio station owned and operated by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs in north central Oregon, began airing a round-the-clock mix of news, cultural programming, music and community announcements.\n\nBut what the station will look like beyond that anniversary is “just a great unknown,” said Sue Matters, the longtime station manager.\n\nAbout 40 percent of its $600,000 annual budget, which pays for six full-time employees, comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That will soon be gone.\n\n“I’d say I’m looking to replace $200,000, ballpark,” Ms. Matters said.\n\nTo fill that hole, everything is on the table, she said, including national programming such as “All Things Considered.”\n\nShe wants instead to prioritize what makes the station a community bulwark: lessons for the tribes’ three languages; announcements for the Warm Springs K-8 public school; coverage of football and other sports from Madras High School; and Native America Calling , a national live call-in program for public radio stations.\n\nTo generate more revenue, she is mulling potentially increasing the rates she charges for sponsorships and corporate support , selling clothing and merchandise and even starting a food cart.\n\nStation management has requested additional funding from the tribe, which provides 40 percent of KWSO’s budget. And so far, there appears to be a willingness, at least in the short run, to cover things like programming fees and subcontracts for the station’s automation system, website and app. But Ms. Matters worries about a zero-sum effect.\n\n“That funding could be going to other things that meet people’s needs like food or housing,” she said.\n\nThe station’s transmitter, atop Eagle Butte, offers commanding views of Mt. Hood and Mt. Jefferson in the distance, and the reservation’s Kah-Nee-Ta hot springs resort in the valley below. And a good thing, too, she said, because KWSO is typically the only station offering local and community news that the reservation’s 4,500 local residents can hear, especially given the “nooks and crannies” of the adjacent Cascades.\n\nInternet access on the Warm Springs reservation, which encompasses 1,000 square miles, is spotty at best. Cellphones often have no bars or display SOS. And in a community where the median household income of $58,900 is three-quarters the national average, maybe 40 percent of residents don’t have television access either, since they can’t afford satellite television services, said Daniel Martinez, the tribal emergency manager.\n\nThat leaves KWSO.\n\n“It’s our conduit to the community,” Mr. Martinez said.\n\nThose concerns were echoed throughout the reservation.\n\n“If we lose the radio station, it’s like you lose an arm or a leg, you lose a foot,” Carlos Calica , vice chair of the tribal council, said at an end-of-summer powwow.\n\nLast spring, when Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress called for the defunding of public broadcasting, they insisted they were pursuing more political balance on the nation’s airwaves. The president called NPR and PBS “radical left ‘monsters,’” while the White House, in an announcement formally asking Congress to claw back funds already allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, dismissed its programming as “woke propaganda disguised as ‘news.’”\n\nBut with the corporation now gone, the question confronting much of the country, where airwaves are dominated by the chain stations of Sinclair Broadcasting and iHeartRadio, will be how any news can compete with the political right.\n\nIn the Badlands of South Dakota, the airwaves are saturated with unapologetic conservatism. The road to the Pine Ridge Reservation cuts through a sea of prairie grass, while over the radio, on 90.3, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump rails against the “radical left.” Up the dial, between Christian pop and classic rock, other syndicated shows argue against in vitro fertilization and feminism.\n\nKILI, the Voice of the Lakota Nation, has been a counterpoint of sorts, but it is now struggling for its life.\n\n“This is scary,” said Oitancan Zephier, manager of the independent station.\n\nKILI is the primary source of local news for one of the poorest parts of the country, delivering updates on tribal politics, wildfires and road closures from a creaky studio where rain sometimes leaks through the foam soundproofing and a stray dog snoozes in the vestibule.\n\nThe station has dealt with money troubles and shoestring budgets since its founding 40 years ago. But the loss of around half its annual income, about $180,000 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, is a different scale of stress.\n\n“We don’t know what next year holds for us,” Mr. Zephier said.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, Mr. Zephier said KILI could switch to “all software programming,” meaning that the flesh-and-blood D.J.s, who play Lakota prayers to start programming every day, tell Lakota-language jokes to connect with elders listening from home and give updates in emergencies, would give way to automation.\n\nTo avoid that, the station is trying to sell stacks of old records. Its website is trying to entice donations from sympathetic listeners by declaring that “KILI is under attack!” Meanwhile, Mr. Zephier is hunting for grants and donations.\n\nBut with its high rates of poverty and unemployment, Pine Ridge isn’t exactly fertile ground for pledge drives, said David American Horse, who is part of KILI’s weekly “Voices of the Elders” program.\n\n“We are barely surviving as a people,” he said. “We don’t have the option of passing around a hat or doing a GoFundMe.”\n\nSenator Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who voted to cut public-broadcasting funds, has said he has secured $9.4 million for tribal broadcasters, but KILI’s board members and staff are unsure whether they will see any of it, or whether it will be enough.\n\nWhen she started her job nearly four years ago, Ms. Schwien, the general manager of Smoky Hills PBS near the geographic center of Kansas, was holding the organization together with the equivalent of Scotch tape and rubber bands. The only PBS station for more than 100 miles was housed in a limestone relic from the 1800s with a defunct toilet and a fly infestation. Employees think it’s haunted.\n\nThen she got a lifeline: a $2.5 million grant for a new building with a studio, a green room and plenty of working toilets to serve the station’s potential audience of 1.2 million viewers.\n\nThis year, just as construction was being completed, government funding was cut, tearing a $1 million hole in her $1.8 million budget.\n\nHer building might be new, but the budget crisis is an existential threat to Smoky Hills PBS, which will have to cut its staff by nearly half unless federal funding is restored. It might even have to abandon its affiliation with PBS entirely, dropping popular programs like “Carl The Collector,” a children’s show.\n\nEven some local programming could be on the chopping block, Ms. Schwien said. Wrestling tournaments and football games are avidly watched but costly to license and produce. Also at risk — “Doctors On Call,” featuring local physicians (one viewer experiencing a heart attack was ordered to go to a hospital), and “The Kansas Legislature,” a political round table with local elected officials. She is considering an application to the Public Media Bridge Fund , an emergency relief effort that aims to help the most vulnerable stations.\n\nLike Ms. Schwien, many PBS general managers have been taking a hard look at their programming this year since Congress began debating whether to pull back funding. In May, an executive at WETA — the PBS station in Washington, D.C., that produces “PBS NewsHour” — met with station executives in Republican states and heard concerns from their members about political bias in the program. “PBS NewsHour” is a linchpin of PBS programming, and its focus on current events can make it a lightning rod in conservative states.",

    "title":"Mass Firing of Probationary Federal Employees Was Illegal, Judge Rules",
    "body":"A federal judge late Friday ruled that the Trump administration’s mass firing of probationary employees earlier this year was illegal, a victory for the labor unions and nonprofit groups that had sued the government over the terminations.\n\nThe ruling did not call on the government to return the fired probationary employees to their jobs, as would be the “ordinary course,” Judge William H. Alsup of the Northern District of California wrote in a 38-page opinion . Because the Supreme Court allowed the administration to continue its purge for months while the case proceeded, he said, “too much water has now passed under the bridge.”\n\nMany of the fired probationary workers in the 17 agencies covered in the lawsuit have been reinstated to their posts, have found new jobs or do not want to return to their old jobs, Judge Alsup said. And for some workers, agency reorganizations over the past few months have eliminated their positions.\n\nEven so, the plaintiffs saw the ruling as a significant win.\n\n“Judge Alsup’s decision makes clear that thousands of probationary workers were wrongfully fired, exposes the sham record the government relied upon, and requires the government to tell the wrongly terminated employees that O.P.M.’s reasoning for firing them was false,” Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement on Saturday, using an acronym for the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm.\n\nThe agency took a leading role in the Trump administration’s early downsizing efforts led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nJudge Alsup found the terminations illegal because they came at the direction of the personnel office and not the agencies where the employees worked, which hold the authority to hire and fire.\n\nHe ordered that the personnel office be prohibited from firing federal employees the way it had done earlier this year.\n\nThe probationary firings were part of a series of federal worker termination programs launched by the Trump administration, all of which face legal challenges. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit recently ruled that a Maryland case challenging the probationary firings should be sent back to the district court and dismissed, because the plaintiffs did not have standing to sue.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, Judge Alsup chided the administration over its conduct in the monthslong case. He said the government’s evidence was a “sham” that included documents unrelated to the case, leaving a reader “with the feeling that he is being led, blindfolded, along a carefully plotted path through a dense, unseen wood.”\n\n“Here and there, he may hear a rustle in the trees, feel the dark silhouette of a towering form or intuit some other hint at the forest beyond. But never is he afforded an unfettered view of the landscape through which he passes,” Judge Alsup wrote. In some cases, he said, the government offered “fabricated” context and “ersatz” evidence. He called some prosecutor conduct “chicanery,” echoing observations he had shared at times during the case.\n\nHe appeared particularly angered by the government’s insistence that the fired workers had ways outside of district courts to challenge their dismissals. Mr. Trump effectively disabled those options when he fired people in key positions, Judge Alsup noted.\n\nThe judge singled out the Federal Labor Relations Authority, an independent board that reviews unfair labor practices. Mr. Trump fired the chair of the board, significantly slowing its work. Mr. Trump also fired a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, where many of the probationary employees turned to challenge their firings. That left the panel without a quorum and unable to make decisions. And the president fired the head of the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistle-blowers, installing a loyalist in his place.\n\nJudge Alsup ordered 17 agencies to issue letters to each fired probationary worker stating: “You were not terminated on the basis of your personal performance.”\n\nWhen he issued a similar order earlier this year, some agencies complied but included legal language that the government did not agree with the court’s opinion. Judge Alsup said the agencies were free to disagree with his opinion and appeal the ruling, but that the letters were “not an appropriate medium for the litigation of those disagreements.”",

    "title":"Federal Judge Questions Deportations to Ghana",
    "body":"A federal judge on Saturday denounced the Trump administration for what she said appeared to be a deliberate scheme to ignore court-ordered protections for a group of deported immigrants who feared persecution in their home countries of Nigeria and Gambia .\n\nBut Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia appeared reluctant to order the return of the five migrants to the United States, instead asking the government to submit a sworn statement detailing its efforts to prevent the deportations of the people to their home countries. Repatriating the migrants would violate the protections they had received from immigration judges in the United States.\n\nAn emergency hearing in the case on Saturday demonstrated how the Supreme Court had paved the way for the deportation of the five migrants in the case, and for President Trump’s mass deportation campaign more broadly.\n\nThough she appeared highly skeptical of the government’s arguments, Judge Chutkan said that her “hands may be tied,” and expressed doubt that a ruling in the migrants’ favor would survive on appeal, pointing to several recent legal victories for the Trump administration’s deportation policies.\n\nJudge Chutkan ultimately did not instruct the government to take specific action on the five deported migrants, and gave lawyers in the case more time to prepare their arguments. It is unclear if more members of the group of deported migrants will soon be deported to their home countries.\n\nIn a recent deal with the Trump administration, Ghana agreed to accept deported migrants with no connection to the West African nation. Federal officials then deported 14 migrants to Ghana last week, five of whom had judges’ orders preventing their deportation to their home countries of Nigeria and Gambia.\n\nBut the five migrants were told by U.S. and Ghanaian officials that they would be sent to their home countries anyway, according to court filings . One of them — a bisexual man from Gambia, where same-sex relationships are criminalized — was sent on Wednesday from Ghana to his home country.\n\nThe other four plaintiffs are still in Ghana, and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent.\n\nEven as Judge Chutkan scolded the Trump administration for allowing Ghanaian officials to violate orders by U.S. immigration judges, she also appeared to suggest that she had little power to compel the government to return the migrants, at least for now.\n\n“I have not been shy about saying that I think this is a very suspicious scheme,” she said during a hearing on Saturday, adding that the Supreme Court had blocked a lower court decision in a similar case earlier this year, “and there’s no point in getting decisions from me that are immediately going to be stayed.”\n\nJudge Chutkan’s remarks, as well as her reluctance to compel the government to return the migrants, amounted to a significant victory for the Trump administration in its mass deportation campaign. The Supreme Court has broadly allowed the government to deport migrants to countries other than their own, and had paused a federal judge’s ruling that said the migrants must first be given a chance to show that they would be at risk of torture.\n\nJustice Department lawyers, in defending the deportations, did not dispute that Ghana sending the migrants to their home countries would violate their court-ordered protections. The lawyers instead leaned on an argument that the Trump administration had previously used in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia , effectively saying that once a migrant had been removed from the United States and was in foreign custody, the issue was out of their hands.\n\n“The United States is not saying that this is OK,” Elianis N. Pérez, a Justice Department lawyer, said during the hearing. “What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”\n\nJudge Chutkan appeared skeptical of that argument, saying that “the lack of that power appears to be by design,” and that it was intended as an “end run around the United States’ obligations.”\n\nShe added: “You send these individuals knowing you can’t repatriate them. You send them to Ghana, and you say, ‘Oh, but Ghana says they’re not going to send them home.’ And Ghana immediately prepares to send them home with what appears to be your full awareness. How is this not a violation of your obligation?”\n\nThe case echoes Mr. Abrego Garcia’s in other ways. One type of legal protection for the five migrants includes a status called “withholding of removal,” the same protection that should have prevented Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation to his home country of El Salvador. He has continued to fight a labyrinthine legal battle against his deportation, and the Trump administration has now sought to deport him to several other African countries that have also agreed to accept deported migrants — a so-called third-country deportation.\n\nThe five plaintiffs in the Ghana case, identified only by their initials for fear of persecution in their home counties, are citizens of Nigeria and Gambia, and have been described in court filings by their lawyers as having “abysmal” living conditions in a remote detention facility known as Dema Camp, at an undisclosed location in Ghana.\n\nOne man, known in court records as K.S., was deported to Gambia despite the fact that he had been granted a legal protection preventing deportation to his home country on the basis of his sexuality. K.S. is a bisexual man, and Gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life in prison. K.S., according to a court filing, is now in hiding in Gambia and fears for his life.",

    "title":"Rubio Heads to a Defiant Israel After Qatar Strike",
    "body":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio departed for Israel on Saturday amid signs that President Trump was growing frustrated about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unrelenting campaign against Hamas prolonging the war in Gaza.\n\nMr. Rubio will land in Israel on Sunday as its military prepares for a major offensive in Gaza City. His visit comes days after an audacious Israeli airstrike targeted Hamas officials in Qatar. Arab and European officials have said that the attack would make ending the conflict even harder.\n\nBefore his departure on Saturday, Mr. Rubio told reporters that the Israeli strike in Qatar would be a focus of his conversations in Israel, and “what impact it’s going to have on efforts to get all the hostages back, get rid of Hamas and end this war. That’s the president’s priority.”\n\nMr. Trump told reporters this week that he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar’s capital, saying that it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals.”\n\nMr. Trump has promised to broker an end to the nearly two-year Gaza conflict, and earlier this month submitted a fresh cease-fire proposal, which he said Israel had accepted.\n\nBut the fighting has raged on. For that, Mr. Trump and Israel blame Hamas, saying that the Palestinian militant group negotiates in bad faith. Mr. Netanyahu’s critics say he has willingly prolonged the war , prioritizing the dismantling of Hamas over the release of some 20 Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza.\n\nMr. Trump has done little to press Mr. Netanyahu to reach terms with Hamas, apart from his sporadic demands that Israel allow more aid into Gaza to prevent mass famine.\n\nA State Department statement announcing Mr. Rubio’s travel and outlining his agenda did not express concern about the coming Israeli offensive into Gaza City, ahead of which Israel has ordered all residents to evacuate . The statement said that Mr. Rubio, who also serves as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, would meet with Israeli officials to discuss their “goals and objectives” for the operation.\n\nMr. Rubio deflected on Saturday when asked whether the United States fully supports an offensive into Gaza City. “I’m not going to get into that in the media, other than to say that the president wants this to be finished with,” he said, referring to the Gaza war generally.\n\nBut Mr. Rubio may urge Israel to conduct a swift operation, said David Makovsky, a former State Department adviser who advised Israel-Palestinian peace talks and now works at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The country could then move toward the political settlement that Mr. Trump, who does not conceal his longing for a Nobel Peace Prize, hopes to clinch.\n\n“I tend to think his time frame is to do it quickly,” Mr. Makovsky said. But he added that a U.S. push to “get it over with” may not “comport with the reality on the ground” — the prospect of grueling urban warfare in the devastated Gazan capital.\n\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Rubio will rebuke Israeli officials over the strike in Qatar, a close U.S. partner that hosts a major American air base. On Friday, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain issued a joint statement condemning the attack as a violation of Qatar’s sovereignty, and said it “poses a serious risk to achieving a negotiated deal” to end the Gaza war.\n\nBut such differences between the Trump administration and Mr. Netanyahu appear largely tactical. And in the swelling international debate about Israel’s approach to the Palestinians, Mr. Rubio appears sure to defend Mr. Netanyahu’s hard-line government.\n\nCalls for recognizing a Palestinian state are growing in major Western capitals, which, like the United States, have long held that statehood can only result from mutual agreement by Israel. But several countries, including France and Canada, said in July that they would recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month.\n\nWhile such recognition would be symbolic, the idea infuriates Israeli officials, who say it amounts to a reward for Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel. Trump administration officials have also denounced the move. (Even Mr. Rubio’s predecessor as secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, wrote last month that the idea was “morally right” but premature as a practical matter.)\n\nIn a ceremony on Thursday celebrating new Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Mr. Netanyahu defiantly insisted that such a state, whose creation would almost certainly require territorial concessions by Israel, would never become reality.\n\n“We said there will be no Palestinian state — and indeed there will be no Palestinian state!” the Israeli leader declared. “This place is ours.”\n\nDuring his visit, Mr. Rubio will reiterate the Trump administration’s “commitment to fight anti-Israel actions, including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism,” the State Department’s statement said.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump’s support for Mr. Netanyahu has come at little political cost, that could change. The length and human toll of the Gaza war, as well as the airstrike in Qatar, have put severe pressure on Israel’s alliances with Gulf Arab states. So has growing talk among Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing allies about annexing the West Bank.\n\nArab officials have warned that Mr. Netanyahu’s actions are threatening the Abraham Accords — agreements brokered by Mr. Trump in his first term that established formal diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, including Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nMr. Rubio’s meetings in Israel will be on Monday, the five-year anniversary of the accords.\n\nMr. Trump claims the Abraham Accords as one of his proudest achievements, and he hopes to extend them to include Saudi Arabia. Analysts say there is little chance of that happening anytime soon, and warn that the existing accords could themselves be in danger.\n\nEarlier this month, a top Emirati official said that Israel’s annexation of the West Bank would be a “red line” that would “end the vision of regional integration,\" in what some analysts read as an implicit reference to a potential withdrawal from the accords.\n\nIt is unclear how those tensions might be resolved, according to Mr. Makovsky, the former State Department official.\n\n“I’m just concerned that we’re entering this escalatory phase right now, and we don’t know the end,” he said. “There’s no off ramp.”\n\nMr. Netanyahu’s approach, he added, “is to just keep going.”",

    "body":"On live television for the past two weeks, Brazil has watched five Supreme Court justices convict former President Jair Bolsonaro of attempting a coup and sentence him to 27 years in prison. He could report to prison next month.\n\nAt the same time, in private meetings across a plaza from the trial, some members of Brazil’s Congress have been discussing how to free him.\n\nThe debate is over whether to grant Mr. Bolsonaro and his fellow defendants amnesty — absolving them of their crimes of trying to overturn the 2022 election — and it has been churning in Brazil for weeks, casting a shadow over a young democracy with a long history of coups.\n\nMembers of Congress have already been circulating legislation, television commentators have been speculating about the chances and dueling protesters on each side have been chanting for and against it. Activists have even projected “no amnesty” with the Brazilian flag on Tower Bridge in London.\n\nAmnesty has quickly become so central to the national conversation in Brazil that, as Mr. Bolsonaro was being tried this past week, it was the elephant in the courtroom: Sure, the former president was about to be convicted — but for how long?\n\nIt is far from certain that Mr. Bolsonaro will eventually be absolved, and the legislative and legal process has a long way to go before that could happen. But that amnesty had already become such a prominent topic, even before a verdict, says much about Brazil, its politics and its history.\n\n“Amnesty is a tradition in our country,” said Ciro Nogueira, Mr. Bolsonaro’s former chief of staff, who as one of leaders in the Senate is now pushing for amnesty. “It has been a way to bring peace and turn the page on the conflicts. Otherwise, you remain stuck with them forever.”\n\nBrazil emerged from a monarchy in 1889, via a coup. Between then and 2022, the nation experienced another 14 military coups, half of them successful. In every failed attempt, the plotters were granted amnesty and were never prosecuted.\n\nThat means Thursday was the first time that Brazil has convicted leaders of an attempted coup with links to the military. In addition to Mr. Bolsonaro, the Supreme Court convicted seven other men, including Mr. Bolsonaro’s running mate, defense minister, national security adviser and navy commander. Nearly all face lengthy prison sentences.\n\n“It is totally unprecedented,” said Carlos Fico, a Brazilian historian and the author of “Brazilian Authoritarian Utopia,” a book on the country’s history of coups. “There has never been punishment for the plotters of a military coup.”\n\nInstead, Brazilian leaders have repeatedly reached for amnesty after destabilizing moments, a bid to ease unrest and move on, Mr. Fico said. Yet that has come with consequences.\n\n“The lack of punishment for coup attempts only brings a temporary pacification because it actually encourages a new coup attempt,” said Fernando Gabeira, a former Brazilian congressman and prominent political analyst. “It doesn’t work because people feel encouraged to try again.”\n\nMr. Gabeira has his own history with amnesty.\n\nIn 1964, Brazil’s military carried out its most consequential coup, launching a dictatorship that lasted two decades. Five years later, Mr. Gabeira helped kidnap the U.S. ambassador to Brazil to protest American support for the dictatorship. His leftist group secured the release of 15 political prisoners before releasing the ambassador.\n\nBut he never faced significant consequences for the kidnapping. That is because in 1979, Brazil passed a broad amnesty law for political crimes. It paved the way for the peaceful end to the dictatorship — but it also meant that very few faced justice for their actions during the dictatorship, including the democratic activists who fought back with violence and the military officials who kidnapped, jailed, tortured and disappeared political opponents.\n\nBy contrast, neighbors like Argentina, Chile and Uruguay experienced similar dictatorships, but have prosecuted many of the military leaders who carried them out.\n\nBrazil’s approach reflects its political culture of conciliation. The current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, was once imprisoned on a corruption conviction for 580 days, but the case was later thrown out and he returned to power.\n\nThat same corruption scandal, Operation Car Wash, once gripped the country after it was revealed that companies had paid billions of dollars in bribes to government officials. But in recent years, judges have quietly set aside convictions and suspended enormous fines.\n\nNow, many people wonder if it all could happen again with Mr. Bolsonaro.\n\n“If amnesty passes, then that old saying that many people repeat — that Brazil is the country of impunity — will truly become reality,” Martele Pereira da Silva, 62, a nutritionist, said this past week at a protest against amnesty in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe answer now lies with Brazil’s Congress. Much of the debate will focus on whether to grant amnesty to Mr. Bolsonaro and his co-conspirators, or only to people convicted of ransacking Brazil’s halls of power in January 2023, in a riot intended to provoke a military takeover.\n\nThe rioters’ sentences have been widely criticized as overly harsh, including a 14-year sentence given to one woman who used lipstick to vandalize an outdoor statue. The Supreme Court, one of the main targets of the riots, handed down the sentences.\n\nA survey of 2,000 Brazilians released Saturday showed that 54 percent opposed amnesty for Mr. Bolsonaro, while 39 percent said they supported it. Support for giving the rioters amnesty is even lower.\n\nYet, in Brazil’s lower chamber of Congress, amnesty appears to have enough votes. After that, there are many hurdles.\n\nThere may also be enough votes in the Senate, the upper chamber, but the Senate’s president has said he would not bring the issue to a vote. Mr. Lula would almost certainly veto any amnesty, though Congress could overturn that. And then the law would also have to survive a likely challenge in the Supreme Court, which has spent years prosecuting Mr. Bolsonaro.\n\nAnother route would have Congress pass a law to reduce sentencing requirements for Mr. Bolsonaro’s crimes, requiring a reduction in his sentence.\n\nHovering over the debate is next year’s presidential election. Mr. Bolsonaro is ineligible to run, but he remains the most popular politician on Brazil’s right.\n\nAnalysts speculate that congressional and party leaders could be offering Mr. Bolsonaro amnesty in exchange for his endorsement of a more moderate candidate in the election. Mr. Nogueira, Mr. Bolsonaro’s ally in the Senate, denied that.\n\nThe next president could also pardon Mr. Bolsonaro, though the Supreme Court has ruled that pardons cannot be used to protect a political ally.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro’s best bet to avoid prison is his expected request to serve his sentence under house arrest because of lingering medical problems from a stabbing he suffered on the campaign trail in 2018 . He recently underwent major surgery, and he watched his trial from home because, his lawyers said, his health is so poor.\n\nAnother former Brazilian president, Fernando Collor, is serving a sentence for corruption at home because of health issues.\n\nIf Mr. Bolsonaro is sent to prison, he still will most likely end up in a less restrictive system within several years — able to work outside the prison during the day, for instance — because of Brazilian law.\n\nWhere Mr. Bolsonaro serves his sentence will be decided largely by Alexandre de Moraes, the Supreme Court justice who led the investigation into the former president and, as a result, became a target of the right.\n\nWhen closing the trial on Thursday, he made clear that amnesty had not worked in the past.\n\n“What leads to peace is due process — a public and transparent trial like this one,” Justice Moraes said. “This is what leads to the healing of wounds, the strengthening of democracy and ensuring that neither a coup attempt nor the abolition of the democratic state ever occurs again.”\n\nAna Ionova contributed reporting.

    "title":"Funicular Crash Has Jarred Lisbon’s Sense of Itself",
    "body":"For more than a decade, Lisbon has been the place to be.\n\nAfter economic near-death experiences in the early 2010s, Portugal used tax breaks, golden visas and inclusive social and immigration policies to attract foreign investors, digital nomads and surf-happy expatriates who formed a cosmopolitan class living it up on the low cost of living.\n\nLuxury towers and hotels sprouted up over long-abandoned areas and graffitied streets often inhabited by poor immigrants who supplied cheap labor. The city’s most handsome neighborhoods, with their tiled facades and parks filled with people drinking cocktails at cafes over the sounds of bossa nova and English, became a modern-day Casablanca for creative types. About 30 percent of Lisbon’s population is not Portuguese.\n\nThat dreamy image of Lisbon as an innovative city on a hill suffered a jarring disruption this month. An iconic funicular — beloved by tourists for its old Lisbon charm — sped out of control on a steep incline and crashed into a wall. The accident killed 16 people, mostly foreigners.\n\nNow, in the political hothouse of an upcoming mayoral election, advocates of increasingly alienated and frustrated locals have seized on the accident to ask what Lisbon has become and whom it is for. They argue that in its courting of wealthy transplants, Lisbon has created gross inequality and priced locals out of their neighborhoods. An administration focused on keeping alive the aura of innovation and growth, they say, has failed to maintain Lisbon’s basic infrastructure and character.\n\n“We are a victim of our own success,” said Rui Bochmann Franco, a left-leaning city councilor who lost a friend in the accident.\n\nAs Mr. Franco rode an elevator in the City Council building the other day, he pointed to an outdated inspection notice that he said he had told the mayor about. “Remind you of something?” he asked, meaning the funicular. The crash, he said, “shows that they invest a lot in showing off, but clearly not enough in basic safety standards.”\n\nInvestigators are still trying to determine the exact cause of the crash. Lisbon’s center-right mayor, Carlos Moedas, has rejected calls to step down.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Moedas said the crash had been politicized and called that “disgusting.” He said maintenance of the funicular, which was subcontracted to private companies, was not the cause of the accident, but he also said it was necessary to wait for the findings of the investigation to explain what happened. He also said he had increased elevator inspections.\n\nOn one thing, at least, he and his critics agree. The main challenge facing Lisbon is managing its growth, and avoiding its becoming a city of foreign haves and local have-nots.\n\n“Lisbon became trendy and Portugal became trendy,” Mr. Moedas said. “I think that’s not bad.” But, he added, “we really have to protect the people of the city” and make sure that “people that are from here are not disadvantaged by people coming here.” He warned that pitting the city’s classes against one another was “very dangerous” and anathema to its cosmopolitan tradition. “Imagine I put a ban on people,” he said. “What would that change? Would that change for better? It would not.”\n\nA center-right emblem of the new Lisbon, Mr. Moedas graduated from Harvard Business School, worked at Goldman Sachs and started an investment management company. He then oversaw a Portuguese agency that put austerity reforms in place and became a European Union commissioner for innovation. Elected Lisbon’s mayor in 2021, he has an office lined with contemporary art. His wife is of Moroccan and Tunisian descent.\n\nHe argued that it was vital for Lisbon to retain its inclusive character in a competitive global marketplace for entrepreneurs and companies that would create opportunities for homegrown talent to stay put and earn better wages. He had sought, he said, to “compensate” those the new economy left behind by providing public services and subsidies, including free public transportation for the young and elderly. His administration had also increased health services and put hundreds of millions of euros into housing . He said 12 percent of Lisbon’s population lived in subsidized municipal housing.\n\nBut some in Lisbon’s middle class, earning lower salaries than many foreigners, take a dimmer view.\n\nOn a street behind the steep hill where the funicular crashed, Rodrigo Jesus, 26, works as an interior designer for a company that serves Airbnb and other firms catering to tourists and foreign residents. The development in Lisbon has been good for his company, he said, “but it’s not good for me.”\n\nHe said he was priced out of the Lisbon market and had to buy a house in another town. And he said it annoyed him that every time he walked into a store, people spoke to him in English because he had red hair.\n\nSome tech entrepreneurs say Lisbon’s international vibe, and the preponderance of English as the new lingua franca, make them feel welcome.\n\nOliver Schmalholz, 53, a tech entrepreneur from Germany who spent 15 years in Austin, Texas, when it was the darling of the tech world, moved to Lisbon in 2021. He said he fell for the cosmopolitan city and didn’t feel like an outsider.\n\nHe said he attended the mayor’s tech incubator, the “Unicorn Factory,” in a once-abandoned part of the city — and hired for his start-up 15 local engineers who might have otherwise left the country. He is engaged to a Portuguese woman and lives in the Infinity, a luxury high-rise. He said his neighbors were international and included “a lot of golden visa buyers,” who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on real estate investments to gain legal immigration status in Portugal.\n\nHe worried that recent measures restricting such visas amounted to the state’s “killing the golden goose.” But he also acknowledged that people outside the tech sector, including doctors and nurses, were being priced out of Lisbon’s center.\n\n“We need the locals,” he said.\n\nBut many locals are leaving. One major reason is the high real estate prices, driven up by foreign residents and speculative investors. Locals have added to the problem by converting their own homes into Airbnbs.\n\n“You hear the noise of the construction? That’s Lisbon now, poor immigrants working on luxury housing for rich immigrants,” said Ana Drago, a former left-wing member of Parliament and now a researcher in urban studies.\n\nShe argued that Portugal’s main export was its own real estate, that the wealthy foreigner class that moved here “seems cosmopolitan, but we know it’s not for us.”\n\n“We feel like we are being expelled,” she said.\n\nIt was simply, said António Brito Guterres, a social worker active in one of the city’s hipster havens, “settler colonialism.”\n\nStill, many here say the city has improved enormously in the last decades. Where before there were open drug markets and abandoned lots, there are now gleaming hotels and pleasant plazas. More young professional Portuguese working for an influx of new companies have stayed instead of leaving the country.\n\nBut on a recent morning at the site of the crash, where memorial bouquets bore Canadian flags, R.I.P. notes for Americans and a toy Mini Cooper, some locals wondered what the accident said about their city.\n\n“I don’t blame the rich people who move to Lisbon,” said Mario Rodrigues, 74, who said he had intended to vote for the mayor but now wasn’t so sure.\n\nAll the foreign investment, he said, “should be used for the protection of people who live in Lisbon.”\n\nTiago Carrasco contributed reporting from Lisbon.",

    "title":"Van Hollen Criticizes Democratic Leaders for Delay in Endorsing Mamdani",
    "body":"Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, endorsed Zohran Mamdani for mayor of New York City on Saturday and called on his party’s leadership to do the same, criticizing them for a delay that he said had allowed President Trump to exploit Democratic divisions.\n\nMr. Van Hollen said Mr. Mamdani, the party’s nominee, was focused on “ensuring that people can afford to live in the place where they work,” a goal that “Donald Trump and New York’s financial elites see that as a threat.”\n\n“Yet, many Democratic members of the Senate and the House representing New York have stayed on the sidelines,” Mr. Van Hollen told a cheering group of Democratic activists and officials gathered on Saturday afternoon in Des Moines. “That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of. They need to get behind him and get behind him now.”\n\nMr. Van Hollen isn’t alone in suggesting it is time for the national party to get behind Mr. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist.\n\nIn recent days, a series of Democrats across the ideological spectrum have argued that it is important for their leaders to forcefully reject Mr. Trump’s apparent interest in tipping the race toward former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a lifelong Democrat who is running in the mayoral race as an independent after losing the primary to Mr. Mamdani.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides, allies and donors have gone to extraordinary efforts to meddle in the race and improve the chances of Mr. Cuomo — though Mr. Trump now appears increasingly resigned to a potential victory by Mr. Mamdani.\n\nMr. Van Hollen’s remarks, delivered at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual party fund-raiser that frequently draws top Democrats, underscore how Mr. Mamdani’s rise has captured the imagination of both national parties. Republicans have tried to use his primary victory to paint a broad swath of Democratic candidates as aligned with socialism and the far-left wing of their party.\n\nDemocrats have praised his focus on affordability and savvy use of social media as a model for their candidates nationwide, though many have been wary of fully embracing him.\n\nDemocratic leaders — including Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader; Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader; and Gov. Kathy Hochul — have so far declined to endorse his bid despite his resounding primary victory in June. Their reluctance has frustrated the left wing of their party, who have typically rallied behind more moderate picks such as former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Van Hollen cast the hesitancy of Democratic officials and strategists as a political mistake, particularly at a time when surveys show voters hold very unfavorable perceptions of the Democratic brand.\n\n“We’ve become a party that too often trims its sails. Too cautious, too rudderless. Too attached to poll-washed, pundit-rinsed, and donor-dried messages,” he said. “What comes out of the wash is all bleached and blow-dried.”\n\nMr. Schumer met with Mr. Mamdani earlier this week and said they would “keep talking.” Ms. Hochul also said she and Mr. Mamdani had been having conversations.\n\nMr. Jeffries has hinted that he was moving toward a decision, saying he would address the election in the coming weeks.\n\n“Leader Hakeem Jeffries will have more to say about the general election well in advance of Nov. 4,” said Justin Chermol, a spokesman for Mr. Jeffries. “Meanwhile, confused New Yorkers are asking themselves the question: Chris Van Who?”\n\nSome Democratic leaders have urged their party to focus intensively on kitchen table economic issues, like high prices. Mr. Van Hollen argued that those economic arguments should not come at the expense of his party challenging the administration on issues like deportations, redistricting and political violence.\n\nHe laid out an agenda for the party that included regulating technology companies, curbing money in politics, reforming the tax code, “sane and fair” immigration reform, lowering prices and raising wages and taking a tougher approach to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Van Hollen cited his involvement in fighting for the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia , a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in the spring. Some in his party, he said, argued that getting embroiled in a fight over a deportation was a “distraction” and potentially politically unpopular, because Mr. Trump’s hard line on immigration had resonated with voters.\n\nMr. Van Hollen saw a different lesson.\n\n“This finger in the wind stuff has got to end. We also need to stop deluding ourselves that the problem is all about messaging, or about volume, or style,” he said. “We don’t just need to fight. We need to fight for something.”",

    "title":"For the First Time in the Mayor’s Race, Cuomo Campaigns at a Mosque",
    "body":"He received a lengthy and warm introduction from one of the mosque’s leaders and rose from his chair. Then, as congregants watched with some bemusement, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo stared intensely at a small notecard and mangled a traditional Arabic greeting. “Assalam Alaikum ,” he finally said, haltingly and after several attempts.\n\nThe slip-up might not come as a surprise. Though Mr. Cuomo has held frequent events at churches, synagogues and Sikh temples, Friday’s visit to the Futa Islamic Center in the Bronx was his first campaign event held at a mosque since he declared his run for mayor in March. Mr. Cuomo, who served as governor of New York for 10 years , faced widespread criticism after he struggled during a primary debate to remember the last time he had visited a mosque at all.\n\nIn his remarks on Friday, Mr. Cuomo spoke of New York as a beacon for newcomers seeking economic opportunity, a message that seemed to resonate with many congregants of the mosque, many of whom emigrated from West Africa.\n\nMr. Cuomo told the congregants that his grandfather’s journey from Italy nearly 100 years ago was no different than theirs, and said that, if elected, he would ensure they found the success that had brought them to New York in the first place.\n\nAnd in a tacit response to the front-runner in the mayor’s race, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who captured the Democratic nomination by focusing on affordability, Mr. Cuomo said he would make buses and subways free for families making less than $50,000 and work to reduce the cost of housing.\n\n“People talk about affordability,\" he said. “Affordability is a new fancy word, because they have to come up with a new fancy word for an old problem. The old problem is the middle class, the working families, the poor, are under tremendous economic pressure.”\n\nHis appearance on Friday before dozens of congregants was emblematic of the more visible approach to campaigning Mr. Cuomo has taken since losing the Democratic primary to Mr. Mamdani, himself a Muslim who has stopped by this congregation multiple times.\n\nRecent polls show Mr. Cuomo, who is now campaigning as an independent, running far behind Mr. Mamdani, as are Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, and Mayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent. Mr. Adams campaigned on Friday at a nearby mosque that predominantly serves West African immigrants as well.\n\nMamadou Diallo, a leader at the Futa Islamic Center who spoke after Mr. Cuomo, said that it was no surprise candidates were flocking to mosques, and that Muslim New Yorkers wanted their voices to be heard. He expressed hope that if Mr. Cuomo were to be elected, he would return and address their concerns about housing costs and crime.\n\nMr. Diallo, 39, said he was unsure who he would support, but he added that many congregants had fond memories of Mr. Cuomo’s governorship.\n\nBoubacar Sowlamougom, 60, a security guard who is originally from Guinea, said he appreciated Mr. Cuomo’s efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour during his governorship.\n\n“He did a good job,” he said.\n\nOthers in attendance, like Osmane Diallo, 23, were less impressed with Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Diallo said he supported Mr. Mamdani in the primary and found Mr. Cuomo’s visit — coming only now, when the general election was nearing — cynical.\n\n“His time has passed,” he said, while acknowledging that Mr. Cuomo had done good work as governor on gun violence prevention. “We need new politicians with fresh ideas.”\n\nIn June, weeks before the Democratic primary, Mr. Cuomo touted the endorsements of “over 100 faith leaders,” a list that included two imams from Brooklyn. In interviews on Friday, both of them told The New York Times that they had never endorsed the former governor’s campaign and had been incorrectly included on the list.\n\n“We were expecting his team to reach out to us and have a meeting. The team did not respond at all,” said one of the imams, Muhammad Siddiqui of Al Madina Mosque Islamic Center of Brooklyn.\n\n“That’s what our experience was, and then they put our name on a list. Rather than frustration, it was carelessness. Right now we are not in position to endorse anyone until we have a serious conversation with them.”\n\nThe other imam, Ahmed Ali of the Igra Masjid mosque, said his congregation had a similar experience in the spring. It was a “miscommunication,” Imam Ali said, adding that the former governor “should have come and spoken with us.”\n\nRich Azzopardi, Mr. Cuomo’s spokesman, said including the imams had been a mistake. The Times reviewed internal Cuomo campaign correspondence that appeared to indicate that there had been a mix-up between two members of the campaign staff, one of whom had told another that the endorsements were confirmed.\n\nMr. Cuomo’s appearance Friday came in the aftermath of a paroxysm of political violence and the day after the 24th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Cuomo alluded to the division in the country presently but on Friday eschewed attacking his opponent by name.\n\nIn recent weeks he has increased the intensity of his criticisms of Mr. Mamdani, whom he has called a terrorist sympathizer .\n\nMr. Mamdani has been a frequent critic of the Israeli government and its invasion of Gaza but has forcefully pushed back on the notion he is antisemitic and has earned the support of many of the city’s Jewish residents .\n\nMr. Mamdani has also spoken bracingly about the experience of growing up as a Muslim in New York City in the aftermath of 9\/11.\n\nOn Friday, reflecting on the precarious moment for many immigrants under President Trump, a local lawyer spoke before Mr. Cuomo and explained recent policy changes relating to how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can detain people. When he finished, about a dozen congregants asked for his card, and still more circulated one of the cards so others could take photos of it.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Cuomo was a loud critic of the administration’s travel ban on residents of predominantly Muslim countries, which was eventually overturned. Earlier in his tenure Mr. Cuomo defended the construction of a mosque that was being planned near the former site of the World Trade Center.\n\n“As a New Yorker, I am a Muslim. As a New Yorker, I am Jewish,” Mr. Cuomo said in January 2017.\n\n“As a New Yorker, we are one community,” he added. “And the New York community is composed of all of the above.”\n\nBut during the primary, Mr. Cuomo’s opponents, especially Mr. Mamdani, said his failure to visit any mosques or Islamic cultural centers while campaigning was evidence of how he was out of touch with the diversity of the city, which is home to hundreds of thousands of Muslims.\n\nMr. Cuomo faced similar criticism for not visiting mosques as governor. During his 2018 run for re-election, his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, criticized his lack of outreach to Muslim New Yorkers. Later that year, Mr. Cuomo visited the Islamic Cultural Center of New York on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, according to his public schedule at the time.\n\nImam Ali, who was mistakenly included on the Cuomo campaign’s list, said he was unsure who he would support in the general election and hoped that he and his congregants would hear from all the candidates.\n\nHe said he had appreciated Mr. Mamdani’s criticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza and his response during a primary debate to a question about where he would travel first if elected mayor: Mr. Mamdani said he would stay in New York City; Mr. Cuomo, answering the same question, said he would travel to Israel.\n\nWhomever he supports, Imam Ali, who is originally from Pakistan and has lived in the United States for more than 20 years, said Mr. Mamdani’s ascendance was a milestone for all Muslims.\n\n“People will say that the Muslim vote matters,” he said. “We will have a voice in the city.”",

    "title":"In ‘Hedda,’ Tessa Thompson Puts a Sexy, Messy Spin on the ‘Female Hamlet’",
    "body":"She has portrayed a rebellious android (“Westworld”), a hard-drinking Valkyrie (“Thor: Ragnarok”), a physicist trapped in an extraterrestrial prism (“Annihilation”) and a songstress with progressive hearing loss (“Creed”).\n\nBut of all the provocative and varied characters that Tessa Thompson, 41, has embodied over the last 20 years, few can match the mythology surrounding Hedda Gabler, the fatefully unhappy housewife conjured by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in his seminal 1891 stage drama of the same name.\n\nIt’s a role so faceted , so rich in Sturm und Drang — many have called Hedda “the female Hamlet” — that actresses including Ingrid Bergman, Glenda Jackson, Isabelle Huppert, Annette Bening, Cate Blanchett, Mary-Louise Parker and Rosamund Pike have flocked to play her.\n\nThis fall, Thompson will star in a big-screen adaptation by the filmmaker Nia DaCosta (“The Marvels,” “Candyman”) that puts her boldly reimagined Hedda, both queer and biracial, at the center of a hedonistic midcentury house party on a lavish English estate. Illicit romances are pursued, careers derailed and psyches unraveled; more than one gun goes off in the night.\n\nThe actress sat down with The New York Times at Amazon’s Manhattan office to discuss “Hedda” (which opens in limited release on Oct. 22 and begins streaming on Prime on Oct. 29) and some of the more radical swerves it takes with the source material. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.\n\nA lot of people who know you from Marvel movies or indie films like “Sorry to Bother You” may not know your background in theater, or that your career started at the Los Angeles Women’s Shakespeare Company. When did you first encounter “Hedda Gabler”?\n\nWell, the first Ibsen I read was actually “A Doll’s House” when I was maybe 17, 18, and I remember being really obsessed. There was something so provocative and daring, I couldn’t believe that it had been written so long ago. Then I got into “Hedda.”\n\nBut I think what it speaks to also is a dearth of — when you talk about the classics, there are incredible plays, but are there a million incredible parts for women? Not necessarily. And so Hedda remains one of those ones that has its own iconography and history and reputation.\n\nYou and Nia first worked together on the 2018 Sundance drama “Little Woods.” Did she already have a “Hedda” vision in her head back then?\n\nA handful of years ago, she told me that she had been thinking about it and wrestling with it. She had gone to see a production of “Hedda” and felt underwhelmed. So I think in terms of the big architectural changes that she made to the piece, those were always inherent to the adaptation that she built from the ground up.\n\nOne major switch involves the gender of the brilliant but alcoholic professor Dr. Lovborg, who is Hedda’s former lover and, as she learns in the first act, her new husband’s rival for a plum teaching position. Now Lovborg is played by the German actress Nina Hoss, who is probably best known in America for “Tár.” How did that come about?\n\nI think the reason these great works are so dexterous is because they contain these fundamental questions and ideas that we’ll wrestle with until the end of time. But there’s something frankly just more interesting about trying to translate it to a modern audience in a way that feels fresh and new, and asking the same question in a way it hasn’t been asked before.\n\nThat was always Nia’s intent. I think she also wanted to use the piece as a way to talk about different expressions of women who are trying to gain agency inside of systems, households, relationships that aren’t built for them.\n\nChanging the gender of that character gives a space where you can do that — you have Hedda, you have Lovborg, and you have [Lovborg’s companion and collaborator] Thea — these three very different women that are all contending with the same thing in diametrically opposed ways.\n\nThe film also moves the setting from 19th-century Norwegian drawing rooms to a wild dinner party at a country estate in postwar England, which opens up a lot of possibilities.\n\nFor me, it felt like the perfect period, because the things that we believed and felt and the way we oriented ourselves in the 1950s, that’s our recent history.\n\nAnd it still permeates culture to a certain extent. Right now you see a resurgence of so many of those ideas globally, but particularly in this country. It’s also lush and fantastic, and there’s a certain kind of decadence to Hedda in general that that time gives us in spades.\n\nBut it has to have some architecture, you have to understand what she’s wrestling against. And certainly in Ibsen’s time, she was such a provocative character because she was so different than the Victorian ideal.\n\nAnd then the Hedda in our rendering also has all the societal pressures of the time, of her gender, of her race, that creates this kind of pressure cooker.\n\nHow did you and Nia want to handle race here, with all those other elements in play?\n\nWe felt like it needed to be a texture, because it would have been at that time, and also because Hedda herself is a woman who has a preoccupation with status.\n\nI think there’s a different landscape in the U.K. that is more about class than it is about race — and yet it’s kind of still about race, you know? But we didn’t want the hat of the piece to be hung too squarely on that.\n\nAnd you also don’t want it to be a hat on a hat on a hat. We were more interested in all the murky, messy things that Hedda’s wrestling with as a woman, nevermind race or any of the other trappings that can sometimes hem us in or define us.\n\nThis is perhaps the hottest “Hedda” to date. A lot of sexy things happen at that house party.\n\nI’ve seen so many versions of the play that still felt kind of wrapped in cliché. Like Jorgen, Hedda’s husband [played in the film by the British actor Tom Bateman], as this sort of sniffly guy — there’s one version I saw where he was always blowing his nose — and we were like, “What if he’s hot, actually?”\n\nMaybe it’s interesting that they have this sort of sexless, potentially loveless marriage, but he’s actually attractive.\n\nDo you have a favorite stage Hedda?\n\nI really loved Fiona Shaw’s. It just felt so different tonally than what I had seen before, and so personal, like a woman who was responding in real time to things as opposed to someone that had this sort of master plan or was an expert manipulator.\n\nAnd Cate Blanchett brought an incredible amount of humor and irony to Hedda that was really delightful.\n\nIn Ibsen’s script, Hedda is 29. But Ingrid Bergman, for one, was 47 when she played her . Do you find that your perspective on the character has shifted since you first encountered her as a teenager?\n\nApproaching the part as a woman of my age now, I think I really understand what it is to contend with a lifetime of choices. And I have a clear understanding of what it may feel like to wake up one day in a life that really you don’t want, that you chose for a combination of reasons that made sense at the time and maybe don’t anymore.\n\nAlso the societal expectation to bear children and what that feels like in your body — this sense of dread if you’re wrong about not doing it. I think that’s something that you only understand as a woman of a certain age who does not have a child.\n\nSomething that I also know Nia was intensely interested in was just female rage. And the longer that you spend as a woman, you amass a lifetime of things that you are probably very angry about and have not had the ability to be honest with yourself about it.\n\nI think it’s one of the joys of Hedda, and maybe one of the reasons so many women want to play her is to allow unabashed access to that.\n\nClassical theater is a pretty rarefied medium. Who do you hope your “Hedda” reaches?\n\nAs universal as some of these plays are, I think there’s been a kind of exclusionary way that they’ve been presented, and an idea of who they’re for. When I went to see “A Doll’s House” recently, there weren’t a ton of people in the crowd that looked like me.\n\nThere are probably some women sitting at home that this might speak to for a variety of reasons, a lot of housewives that are popping on Amazon Prime. So I’m interested in them. Hey, baby, how are you doing? [Laughs]",

    "title":"Opinion | Tyler Robinson and Our Poisonous Internet",
    "body":"Moments into a Friday morning news conference announcing the apprehension of a suspect in Charlie Kirk’s killing, the governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, began to read aloud the phrases reportedly engraved on the assassin’s bullet casings:\n\n“Notices bulges OWO what’s this?”\n\n“Hey fascist! Catch!”\n\n“Oh bella ciao bella ciao bella ciao ciao ciao.”\n\n“If you read this you are gay lmao.”\n\nThese cryptic words were read tentatively by Mr. Cox, who seemed to have little idea of their meaning and provided no further context. The governor also relayed how the suspect, Tyler Robinson, 22, communicated his actions to friends on the Discord group chat platform. One relative, Mr. Cox said, described Mr. Robinson as “full of hate.”\n\nThe only thing that can be said conclusively about Mr. Robinson, at this moment, is that he was a chronically online, white American male.\n\nThe internet’s political communities and the open-source sleuths currently scrambling to place Mr. Robinson into a coherent ideological camp certainly won’t be content with any of this. Nor will they be satisfied with the other likelihood awaiting us: that Mr. Robinson, the son of a seemingly content Mormon family , probably possesses a mishmash of ideological stances. Some held dearly. Others not so much. They also will not be satisfied that this horrific, society-changing act of violence was most likely committed both as an ironic gesture and as a pure political statement.\n\nIf your head is spinning from the internet’s attempts to read into Mr. Robinson’s alleged choices and political identity, that’s understandable. We’ve fully stepped into a different historical moment: the age of brain-poisoning meme politics.\n\nDespite mounting evidence that the toxic energies of the internet have begun to spill over into our real lives, there has been a reluctance to take the things happening online very seriously. The revolting death spectacle that took place at Utah Valley University is a new kind of political event.\n\nWhile the internet’s rot once felt safely bottled, or fire-walled, within a digital realm, this act of political violence may have punctured whatever barrier once existed. We can no longer ignore that we live in an era where the online and the lived are indistinguishable.\n\nToday’s internet for most Americans, but especially for those like Mr. Robinson, who came of age on social and streaming platforms, is an immeasurably potent vibes machine. One powered by a complex fuel of negative emotions — hatred, rage, hopelessness, nihilism, grievance, cynicism, paranoia, discontent and addiction. It’s a machine more than capable of constructing false realities and corroding our lived experiences.\n\nIntent, meaning and sincerity are near-valueless concepts in this realm, while things like knowledge, understanding and good faith — critical elements to any healthy public sphere — have been gradually distorted beyond the point of recognition, or abandoned completely.\n\nTo exist in this machine is to exist in a realm dominated by what the writer Anton Jäger termed “hyperpolitics,” for the “low-cost, low-entry” politics with little ties to political institutions or clear political outcomes. To be a young person on large areas of the internet, in other words, is to exist in a state of perpetual conflict, where every action, every event, is coded with political significance, couched in irony or presented in a combative posture, starting from the moment one goes online.\n\nIt’s rapidly driving a generation mad. (And the rest of us, as well.) Governor Cox made a blunt declaration at Friday’s press conference. “Social media is a cancer on our society,” he said. “Go outside and touch grass.”\n\nThe beliefs flourishing in these online political spaces are fringe ideas — from conspiratorial thinking about the 2020 election, paranoia about white replacement, the glorification of political violence and moral panics built on stereotypes about minority groups. And they are fed to people on an algorithmically driven conveyor belt in the form of grotesque memes, viral streams, images of death and destruction, ironic posturing and trolling.\n\nIt’s likely that the influence of this machine, and its ability to drive young people to the radical fringes, would be diminished if American life today wasn’t governed by a sense of chaos and collapse. Economic insecurity, increasing unemployment, the inability to start families or buy homes, coupled with a livestreamed parade of death emanating from Gaza and the Trump administration’s deployment of the National Guard into American cities, are just a few obvious factors driving these feelings.\n\nFigures like Mr. Kirk, along with other right-wing influencers, including Ben Shapiro, Laura Loomer and the white nationalist Nick Fuentes, have thrived in this new landscape. They’ve used the internet’s reactionary machinery to great profit, building mass followings and influence in the process. Mr. Kirk, who had one of its loudest and most recognizable voices, was an avatar of the new political species moving through this machine: a type of political entity, combining elements of celebrity, demagogue, shock jock, thought leader, content creator and activist. Turning Point USA, the campus activism group he co-founded, operated less like an organized political movement and more like a curious followership or fandom.\n\nThe message propagated by Mr. Kirk, in his regular livestreams and during his famous campus debates, has been strangely labeled “ moderate ” in the immediate aftermath of his death. Conservative media and traditional outlets alike have celebrated his reputation for a willingness to foster open dialogues and the exchange of free ideas.\n\nThis characterization is out of step with the reality of Mr. Kirk’s activism, which was defined by a pugilistic bigotry and dehumanizing political rhetoric. He warned white Americans to be on the lookout for “prowling Blacks” and described George Floyd as a “scumbag.” He promoted the “great replacement” theory, accused Jewish philanthropists of funding “anti-whiteness,” and claimed that, if President Trump lost the 2024 election, Alabama would be overrun by “hundreds of thousands of Haitians.”\n\nA young internet user following just Mr. Kirk could offer a fairly accurate glimpse into the atmosphere of perpetual rage-baiting that is today’s internet. Mr. Kirk lived to pick apart cotton-mouthed college freshmen at his signature campus debate events, each noted on his social channels with some belligerent title: “Charlie Kirk Crushes Woke Lies.” “Charlie Kirk Hands Out Huge Ls.” “Charlie Kirk vs. the Washington State Woke Mob.” And regularly, he lashed out at his perceived political foes, like Zohran Mamdani, the New York mayoral candidate whom he recently described as a “self-righteous, narcissistic parasite” who “should be expelled from politics.” To be clear, Mr. Kirk’s ideas, however distasteful and problematic, are no justification for murder.\n\nWhat’s apparent, looking back on his ideas and the style in which he expressed them, is that Mr. Kirk used his platform to coarsen our political discourse, draining it of that vital bulwark against real-world violence: empathy.\n\nWhile much has been made of his ability to connect with Gen Z, there has been little effort to hold his legacy to account for failing to impart this critical human quality to his young audiences. “The Youth Whisperer of the American Right,” as this paper once called him , may have been precisely that, a showman who attracted disaffected young Americans into the conservative movement with fantasies of white replacement or racial grievance.\n\nThe combative and rage-bait style that Mr. Kirk pioneered has become the dominant mode for the right. And it’s probably more accurate to say this is how many young Americans as a whole exist on the internet today, trolling and provoking anyone who crosses their paths.\n\nBack in July, in an essay about the trolling style of politics infecting conservatism, I wrote that “conflict itself is the high-voltage current that powers online engagement and amplifies messages.” Mr. Kirk was a master architect of political conflict, engineered for maximum reach.\n\nThat his killer might have been in pursuit of a similar moment of viral conflict is a grim encapsulation of the nightmare cesspit we’ve entered.\n\nThe internet machine is now operating out in the open, in front of everyone’s eyes, and as long as that continues unchecked, our ability to make meaning of the world will continue to deteriorate. Empathy, as a human quality, will be snuffed out for those who are chronically online. The memes, and the memetic violence, will continue to proliferate.\n\nNathan Taylor Pemberton writes about extremism and American politics.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "title":"Opinion | They Came for the Oil. They Took Everything.",
    "body":"When I was a child, my mother would take me to bathe in a spring near my village. By the water there were palm trees, and in them papanes, birds found in the lush forests of the gulf coast in the Mexican state of Veracruz, where I live. They would break into song as we’d approach the spring, and other animals would flee.\n\nMy town, Escolín, is an Indigenous community that sits between Papantla, a tourist city named for the birds, and Poza Rica, an oil town whose name means “rich well.” Many of the wells that supply oil to Poza Rica are near Escolín. When the sun goes down, nearby gas flares paint the night red.\n\nI was born under these blood-tinted skies; they always seemed natural to me. But I’ve wondered what my forebears must have thought the first time the night sky turned red, when commercial oil extraction began in the area over a century ago. Maybe that hell was coming out of the earth.\n\nIn 1928 the Shell-owned company El Águila struck oil just west of Poza Rica — the first major oil discovery in the Indigenous region of Totonacapan, which spans the states of Veracruz and Puebla. So began, for my people, the white man’s exploitation of ixchalatiyat, Totonac for “the oil extracted from the heart of the earth.”\n\nIn the decades that followed, the region was invaded. Peasants had gained rights to use land as members of ejidos, or communal farms, in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 to 1920. But amid growing interest in the area’s oil deposits, Pemex, the state-owned oil and gas company, snatched much of the territory by expropriating swaths of forest under federal law.\n\nOutsiders did other things to extinguish our relationship with our land, too. Government-run schools stigmatized the Totonac language, encouraging us to speak Spanish instead. Christian missionaries quashed our traditional beliefs, suggesting that the earth was a resource to be exploited. All that remained of our cosmogony were stories: tales told to scare children but plundered of the deep beliefs that gave meaning to our ties with the earth.\n\nAll the while, heavy machinery made its way through the mountains, razing vanilla plants and orange groves. Pemex began sending more and more workers to develop new wells. By night, flames would pulse between the trees.\n\nBy the 2010s, ecological destruction had become the norm.\n\nThe soil bled around the town; residents would leave home and find oil gushing from fractures in the earth.\n\nOil would soak through the ground, poisoning our water, our fruit trees, the soil in which we would plant corn.\n\nAnimals disappeared, fleeing noise and pollution.\n\nWe stopped being surprised. The message from the government seemed to be: This is the modern world. Get used to it.\n\nIn 2017 a pipeline exploded just outside Escolín. We woke up to the sound and rose to the glow of the forest on fire. When it happened again in 2022, Pemex personnel reportedly told inhabitants to leave the town. “It’s possible that there will be more explosions,” they stated, according to the National Indigenous Congress, “and we don’t take responsibility for the lives of any residents” who chose to remain.\n\nThe earth wasn’t just weeping fire, gas and oil; it was leaking poison. Prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons has been linked to respiratory issues , birth defects and higher rates of cancer . In the town of Emiliano Zapata, one of the most polluted communities in Totonacapan, where two of the area’s streams are black with toxic sludge and the streets reek of oil and gas, residents fear for their health.\n\nIndigenous people across Totonacapan haven’t just suffered from the destruction of our land; in the face of escalating cartel violence, we have also been harassed and detained, persecuted, abused and, increasingly, killed.\n\nI began organizing my community in 2013, after a federal energy reform opened the oil industry to private investment, accelerating foreign companies’ entry into the region. Working with other activists, I became involved in the fight for Indigenous sovereignty — a multipronged struggle against environmental destruction, economic marginalization and organized crime.\n\nI saw how, in areas where Pemex had a bigger presence, cartel cells appeared, and people were murdered and disappeared almost at random. Violence took hold in Totonacapan years before, as the state went to war with the cartels and the cartels went to war with one another, leaving innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. But this was different.\n\nCartels have profited enormously from fuel theft across Mexico. In areas like Papantla, which are dense with oil wells and refineries, cartels come to tap Pemex-owned pipelines and resell the fuel on the black market, a practice so common, it has its own slang term: huachicol. In my town, we felt the difference as organized crime moved in to make a profit off the contraband fuel.\n\nCartel safe houses appeared in the mountains — operation centers with telecommunication antennas and advanced infrastructure. Armed men in civilian clothes patrolled roads leading to oil wells. Businesses closed.\n\nMore lifeless bodies began to appear near the highway that connects Papantla and Poza Rica — especially by the section known as the Devil’s Curve, only half a mile from Escolín. In the fall of 2016 authorities found the corpses of two priests who were dragged out of a church at gunpoint the day before. Violence does not discriminate.\n\nFarmers found bodies in their fields.\n\nThere were curfews; people stopped going out after dark.\n\nMany locals were forcibly removed from their land — or simply chose to leave when a family member was disappeared.\n\nAnd more and more people vanished.\n\nIn the late 2010s, a collective of family members of the disappeared contacted residents in Escolín. The relatives wanted to search for their loved ones under the earth of our town. I began accompanying them, this group of more than 200 parents searching for their lost children.\n\nI became close friends with a man named Magdaleno Pérez Santes, whose daughter, Diana Paloma, disappeared not far from my home in 2019. Then, on a Sunday in the spring, Maleno, as he was known to us, was detained by the municipal police before a scheduled effort to locate her. Upon his release a day later, he showed signs of having been brutally beaten. He died of his injuries shortly after that.\n\nThe search collective has located numerous extermination sites in Totonacapan — places used by the cartels to incinerate the remains of their victims. One day I took an Indigenous ritualist to one of these sites. It was a ranch in the middle of the jungle known as La Gallera, where a large pile of human ash and skeletal remains had been found inside a bread oven.\n\nWhen he arrived, he spoke of how the mothers of the disappeared had cursed the forest because they saw it as the place where their children were taken to be tortured, burned and erased from the world. As he performed a ritual to purify the space, he remarked that the land was both a victim and a survivor of this violence.\n\nToday, across Totonacapan, oil has become synonymous with ecological destruction, cartel violence and political disenfranchisement. The government promotes Mexico’s Indigenous population for tourist or public relations purposes but has not done enough to help those of us whose hometowns are flooded with oil or besieged by organized crime. In a bid to revitalize Pemex, which is deeply in debt, President Claudia Sheinbaum is looking to expand the use of fracking, a highly destructive practice that involves fracturing bedrock deep in the earth, in areas like mine.\n\nAgainst all odds, people in my town and other Indigenous communities across Mexico continue moving, walking the paths of resistance that our ancestors opened with great effort. I still find cause for hope when I see women organizing together, communities defending their territory, parents searching for their children. We have no choice but to fight, because it is a fight for our survival. But it is not easy.\n\nEventually, the spring where I used to bathe dried up. Small pipelines had been installed around the town, draining water away from us.\n\nThose springs had been our sources of water for generations, and some people in Escolín tapped the pipes to steal back what had been theirs. The water that came out was different: It was tinted yellow and smelled of gas. Some hired a truck to deliver clean water, for fear of contamination. Many of us, though, had no choice. We drank the foul liquid anyway.\n\nOmar Lázaro García is an environmental and human rights activist from Escolín, Mexico, and a member of Mexico’s National Indigenous Congress.\n\nManuel Bayo Gisbert is a Mexican photographer documenting human rights violations in Mexico.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "body":"Romania said on Saturday that its air force had detected a Russian drone in the country’s air space, days after Western officials condemned an incursion of Russian drones into Poland as an escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe defense ministry of Romania, a NATO member, said in a statement that the country had deployed two F-16 aircraft shortly after 6 p.m. local time to monitor Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian infrastructure near the Romanian border. About 20 minutes later, they detected the drone in Romanian airspace .\n\nRomania’s foreign minister, Oana-Silvia Toiu, said on social media that the Romanian Air Force tracked the Russian drone in the country’s airspace for 50 minutes before it left without causing any damage or casualties. She called the intrusion “unacceptable and reckless.”\n\nThe defense ministry said the drone had not flown over populated areas or posed an imminent danger to people’s safety.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, the Russian defense ministry had not responded publicly to the Romanian comments.\n\nThe brief incursion occurred days after more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting NATO to scramble fighter jets to shoot some of them down.\n\nThe incident in Poland last week was the first time in NATO’s history that alliance fighters had engaged enemy targets in a member’s airspace, officials said. It prompted Poland’s government to invoke Article 4 of the NATO treaty , a rarely used mechanism that is triggered when a member is under threat and prompts a formal discussion within the alliance.\n\nRussia denied targeting Poland and said that its drones had gone off track after their navigation systems were jammed.\n\n“There were no targets marked on Polish territory,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday. He also claimed that Russia’s drones did not have the capacity to reach Polish airspace, which is false .\n\nThis is not the first time a Russian drone has crossed into Romanian territory.\n\nIn September 2023, Romania said that debris from a Russian drone had landed on its soil across the Danube River from Ukraine. Russia had been conducting a series of nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian grain ports on the Danube delta to block Ukraine from exporting its agricultural products via a route that runs down the river and into the Black Sea.\n\nRomania’s defense ministry also said in September 2024 that it had found fragments from Russian drones that had landed in Romania on the banks of the Danube River.\n\nIn a social media post about the apparent Russian drone incursion into Romania on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that the Russian military “knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air.”\n\n“This cannot be a coincidence, a mistake, or the initiative of some lower-level commanders,” he added. “It is an obvious expansion of the war by Russia — and this is exactly how they act. Small steps at first, and eventually big losses.”",

    "title":"The German Elections That Are Set to Test the Attraction of the Far Right",
    "body":"On Sunday, voters in hundreds of cities, towns and villages across Germany’s most populous state will choose their next local officials.\n\nAlthough the elections, in North Rhine-Westphalia, have no direct effect on national politics, many in Germany are watching them as a measure of the country’s mood. They are the first electoral test for the Christian Democratic Union party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz since he assumed office in May.\n\nSince Mr. Merz won the national election in February, the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has continued to surge in popularity , with polls showing that a quarter of voters back it.\n\nThe AfD, which Germany’s domestic intelligence service has designated an extremist party , is now neck and neck with Mr. Merz and his conservative alliance, which won 28.5 percent of the vote but whose support has fallen to 26 percent, according to polls.\n\nThe center-left Social Democrats, who are the junior partner in Mr. Merz’s government coalition, are faring even worse.\n\nHere is what to know about the vote on Sunday.\n\nPolls for the races in North Rhine-Westphalia either do not exist or are unreliable, so it will became clear only after ballots are counted on Sunday night whether Mr. Merz’s governing coalition in Berlin has hurt or helped the Christian Democratic Union in the state elections.\n\nThe party traditionally performs well in rural areas, small towns and villages. But support in these areas is mostly based on the records of local politicians, meaning that Mr. Merz’s policies, such as trying to curb migration, reboot the economy or rebuild the army, could be less important to voters.\n\nFor the Social Democrats, Sunday’s elections could hurt. Many of the regions’s blue-collar workers, the traditional base of the party, are expected to turn to the AfD, which has attracted them in other states. A major loss of support from its core voters in a former heartland would be a serious setback for the party.\n\nThis is the biggest question. Some analysts and politicians have raised the possibility of a far-right sweep in the industrial heartland of the state, where unemployment and dissatisfaction with federal politics are high.\n\nWhile the AfD’s appeal has been growing across the country, the party has not been able to establish itself in any city government in what used to be West Germany. A victory would be major milestone.\n\n“The AfD benefits from the weakness of the SPD,” said Andreas Blätte, a political scientist at the University Duisburg-Essen in the state, referring to the Social Democrats. Professor Blätte added that the AfD could win in traditionally working-class areas, and warned that even if their victories were isolated to just a few cities it would be a shock for the mainstream political parties.\n\n.\n\nGelsenkirchen, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia that used to be a center of heavy industry and coal mining, is one of the places where the AfD is expected to do well, analysts say, and the party could even win the mayoralty. During the national election, the AfD won 25 percent of the vote in the city, 7 percentage points more than the party scored across western Germany.\n\nThe city has high unemployment and poverty and a big immigrant community. Many voters there are fed up with the Social Democrats, which have been running Gelsenkirchen for the past 15 years.\n\n“I could see, given the mood and the fact that people are ready to teach someone a lesson, that the AfD could do quite well,” said Jörg Pfnister, who runs a small wine bar at an outdoor market where locals meet every Wednesday evening.\n\nMr. Pfnister, who used to work at the nearby Opel car factory, said he saw the downtown dying out as people forgo the more expensive shopping there for discount or migrant-run supermarkets at city’s peripheries.\n\nNorbert Emmerich, a financial adviser and a member of the City Council who is the AfD’s candidate for mayor, was guarded when asked about his chances. He said he expected between a quarter and a third of the vote, a long way from the 50 percent needed to win. However, given that there are nearly a dozen contenders for the mayor, many predict a runoff between the top two parties. A second round of voting would be held on Sept. 28.",

    "title":"Hermeto Pascoal, Prolific Brazilian Composer, Dies at 89",
    "body":"Hermeto Pascoal, the eccentric, prodigiously prolific Brazilian composer and self-taught multi-instrumentalist who rose from a childhood of rural privation to become a favorite of jazz musicians and audiences around the world with a taste for the unpredictable and adventurous, has died. He was 89. .\n\nHis family announced his death on his official social media page on Saturday night. The statement did not provide a cause of death or say when or where he had died.\n\nKnown in Brazil as “The Sorcerer” and “The Mad Genius,” Mr. Pascoal affected a wild man’s appearance: He had long, unkempt hair, a thick beard and a childlike demeanor. But he was passionately serious about playing and composing music.\n\nHe wrote more than 2,000 instrumental pieces, many with quirky time signatures or harmonies, and orchestrated or arranged hundreds more songs for others, including jazz luminaries like Miles Davis, who once described Mr. Pascoal as “one of the most important musicians on the planet.”\n\nMr. Pascoal’s primary instruments were the piano and the flute. He also played tenor and soprano saxophones, guitar, drums, accordion, euphonium and a variety of other keyboard, reed, brass and percussion instruments — and often supplemented them, to the delight of audiences, with everyday objects whose capacity to create music only he seemed able to imagine.\n\nBath toys, teapots, tuned bottles of water, bicycle pumps, chairs, dolls, anvils and even his own beard were among the items he employed. While recording the album “Slaves Mass” for Warner Bros. Records in 1976, he brought a pair of live pigs into the studio and “played” them as if they were bagpipes, incorporating their squeals into the mix.\n\nHermeto Pascoal Oliveira da Costa was born on June 22, 1936, in Olho d’Água das Flores, a rural settlement in the impoverished northeastern Brazilian state of Alagoas. As an albino, unable to work in the fields under a harsh tropical sun with other members of his peasant family, he was allowed to remain at home, where at age 7 he taught himself to play his father’s small button accordion and also began playing a fife he had fashioned from a dried gourd.\n\nHe began his professional career at 10 by playing rural dances and weddings. Word of his prowess had spread by the time he was 14, and he was invited to join the house band of a radio station in Recife that specialized in hillbilly music. Shortly thereafter he formed a novelty act with Sivuca, another albino accordionist (with whom he would often be confused), and the two played forró and other popular styles of music all over northeastern Brazil.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, Mr. Pascoal had migrated 1,500 miles southward to Rio de Janeiro, then Brazil’s capital, where he joined another radio station orchestra, discovered jazz and began to perform in nightclubs. In his spare time, he learned to play piano, flute and saxophone, and, after an interlude in São Paulo, he joined the percussionist Airto Moreira in 1964 in the Rio-based Quarteto Novo.\n\nThat group backed Brazilian stars of the day such as Edu Lobo and Geraldo Vandré and also worked with the emerging singer Elis Regina. Mr. Pascoal played both piano and horns in the quartet. He rapidly built a reputation as an adaptable, resourceful composer and an arranger who could write rapidly, and blend jazz and northeastern folk styles.\n\nAt the urging of Mr. Moreira, who had joined Miles Davis’s ensemble, Mr. Pascoal came to the United States in late 1969. He soon recorded his first album as a leader, in a big-band session released in 1971 that featured top-flight New York jazz musicians like the bassist Ron Carter, the trumpeter Thad Jones, the flutist Hubert Laws and the saxophonist Joe Farrell. He also began a brief but fruitful association with Davis, who included three Pascoal compositions on his “Live-Evil” album, released in 1971: “Igrejinha” (“Little Church”), “Nem Um Talvez” (“Not Even a Maybe”) and “Selim.”\n\nAs word spread of Mr. Pascoal’s fondness for complex harmonies, dense orchestrations and zigzagging melody lines, as well as his versatility and unusual appearance, he became an object of fascination among musicians, a phenomenon that continued until the end of his life. His songs, of which there seemed to be an endless stream, were recorded by Cannonball Adderley, Gil Evans, John McLaughlin, Charlie Haden and others. Later in Mr. Pascoal’s career, the Kronos Quartet commissioned him to write a piece for them, “Marcando Tempo” (“Marking Time”), which became a regular part of their repertoire.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Mr. Pascoal had a firmly established reputation in the jazz world as both a talented musician and an amiable oddball. Davis affectionately referred to him as “that crazy albino,” and in Downbeat magazine the critic Howard Mandel compared him to two other notable eccentrics, writing that he was “as pan-global a leader as Sun Ra and as sure-footed an individualist as Rahsaan Roland Kirk.”\n\nThough Mr. Pascoal continued to tour in the United States and Europe, he went back to Brazil to live and, thanks to his international reputation, for the first time was able to form a permanent band of his own. Commercial engagements at home were few, but his rehearsals became famous for their rigor, and Mr. Pascoal and his band made numerous records, in an idiom that was primarily jazz but also included elements of bossa nova and Brazilian folk music.\n\nAs a more prosperous Brazil became a popular touring stop for foreign musicians, those visitors — among them Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie and Chick Corea — would invite Mr. Pascoal to join them onstage when they performed in Rio or São Paulo. At the same time, a younger generation of musicians in the United States and Europe sought out Mr. Pascoal’s early recordings and talked him up in music publications.\n\nIn 1997, Mr. Pascoal embarked on a whimsical project: writing one song a day for an entire year, beginning on his birthday, so that everyone could have a personalized birthday song. The songs were never officially released on CD, but his notated “Calendar of Sound” was eventually published in book form and has become a collector’s item among musicians.\n\nMr. Pascoal’s wife of 46 years, the former Ilza da Silva, died in 2000. At a performance in October 2002 in Londrina, Brazil, he met Aline Paula Nilson, a singer and dancer known professionally as Aline Morena, who became his companion and prompted him to leave Rio and move to Curitiba, her hometown in southern Brazil.\n\n“The instrument I like most is whatever instrument I happen to be playing at the moment,” Mr. Pascoal said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. And, he added, “Since everything is an instrument, from the burble of water to a symphony orchestra, there is never a moment I am without music.”",

    "title":"Pilot union urges FAA to reject Rainmaker’s drone cloud-seeding plan | TechCrunch",
    "body":"Rainmaker Technology’s bid to deploy cloud-seeding flares on small drones is being met by resistance from the airline pilots union, which has urged the Federal Aviation Administration to consider denying the startup’s request unless it meets stricter safety guidelines.\n\nThe FAA’s decision will signal how the regulator views weather modification by unmanned aerial systems going forward. Rainmaker’s bet on small drones hangs in the balance.\n\nThe Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) told the FAA that Rainmaker’s petition “fails to demonstrate an equivalent level of safety” and poses “an extreme safety risk.”\n\nHowever, Rainmaker CEO Augustus Doricko said an email that all of the union’s objections are based on only the public notice, rather than non-public documents submitted to the FAA that outline all of the company’s safety data and risk mitigations.\n\nRainmaker is seeking an exemption from rules that bar small drones from carrying hazardous materials. The startup filed in July, and the FAA has yet to rule. Instead, it issued a follow-up request for information, pressing for specifics on operations and safety.\n\nIn its filing, Rainmaker proposed using two flare types, one “burn-in-place” and the other ejectable, on its Elijah quadcopter, to disperse particles that stimulate precipitation. Elijah has a maximum altitude of 15,000 feet MSL (measured from sea level), which sits inside controlled airspace where commercial airliners routinely fly. Drones need permission from Air Traffic Control to fly inside this bubble.\n\nRainmaker’s petition says it will operate in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace unless otherwise authorized. ALPA notes the filing doesn’t clearly state where flights would occur or what altitudes would be used. However, Doricko said the documents submitted to the FAA disclosed that in addition to the flights being constrained to a max altitude of 15,000 feet MSL, they will be conducted in airspace that is predetermined to be safe by aviation authorities, “voiding any reasonable concern about high altitude flight or airspace coordination.” ALPA did not reply to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.\n\nThe union also objects to the flares themselves, citing concerns about foreign object debris and fire safety. ALPA points out that the petition does not include trajectory modeling of the ejectable casings or analysis on the environmental impacts of chemical agents.\n\n“Regarding their objection to the use of flares, independent bodies like this administration’s EPA and multiple state departments of natural resources have studied the dispersion and environmental safety of materials used in cloud seeding for over 70 years and never found any adverse effect from cloud seeding,” Doricko said.\n\nSam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager, said the company respects the pilot’s union and hopes to “continue to strengthen our relationship with the organization,” but claimed the objection “shows a lack of understanding of why Rainmaker has filed for this exemption.”\n\n“Our use of flares in unmanned systems is solely for research purposes in a controlled flying environment and is not a part of our larger ongoing operations,” Kim added.\n\nDoricko said that a typical Rainmaker operation disperses 50-100 grams of silver iodide, and far less than that in a flight with flares, while one hour of flight of a commercial plane releases kilograms of uncombusted volatile organics, sulfur oxides, and soot – significantly more material than a Rainmaker op.\n\n“Rainmaker is interested in doing the best, responsible atmospheric research and is thus comparing flares to our proprietary aerosol dispersion system that will replace flares and exclusively emit silver iodide. ALPA’s objection to this exemplifies their limited understanding of our CONOP, all of which contains extensive risk mitigations in the non-public docs that the FAA is reviewing now,” Doricko said.\n\n“Regarding ALPA’s concerns about coordination with aviation authorities and airspace, our flight operations consist of broadcasting signals, intentional coordination with local ATC, certified pilots, and a collision avoidance system that involves electronic and physical observers,” he said.\n\nHowever, Rainmaker says the flights will occur over rural areas and over properties owned by private landlords “with whom Rainmaker has developed close working relationships.”\n\nCloud-seeding already happens today, largely in the western U.S., with crewed airplanes flown in coordination with state agencies. Ski resorts commission the operations to help keep their runs white, and irrigation and water districts fly them to build snowpack in the winter to help feed their reservoirs during the spring melt.\n\nThe general practice of cloud seeding dates back to the 1950s. By spraying small particles into certain clouds, scientists found they could induce precipitation. Typically, cloud-seeding operations use silver iodide for the particles, mostly because they mimic the shape of ice crystals.\n\nWhen a silver iodide particle bumps into droplets of water that are super-cooled, they cause the droplet to rapidly freeze because its water is already below the freezing point. Once the ice crystal forms, it can grow quickly if conditions are right, faster than a liquid water droplet would in similar circumstances. Plus, the rapid growth helps the crystals stick around longer than a water droplet, which might evaporate before it has a chance to fall as precipitation.\n\nRainmaker’s twist — doing this work with drones instead of pilots — could prove safer in the longer term. The company points out that the flight profiles are tightly bounded, overseen by a remote pilot and trained crews, over rural areas, with other safety checks in place.\n\nWhat happens next hinges on whether the FAA thinks those mitigations are sufficient. However it’s decided, the agency’s response will likely set the tone for novel cloud-seeding approaches.\n\n9\/13\/2025: The story has been updated to include Rainmaker’s comments from Augustus Doricko, founder and CEO, and Sam Kim, Rainmaker’s aviation regulatory manager .\n\nTopics\n\nReporter, Space and Defense\n\nAria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

    "body":"President Donald Trump made countering immigration one of his flagship issues during last year’s presidential campaign, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nIn his first eight months in office, that promise turned into around 350,000 deportations, a figure that includes deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (around 200,000), Customs and Border Protection (more than 132,000), and almost 18,000 self-deportations, according to CNN .\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass deportation campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented immigrants. To aid its efforts, the ICE has at its disposal several technologies capable of identifying and surveilling individuals and communities.\n\nHere is a recap of some of the technology that ICE has in its digital arsenal.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nContact Us Do you have more information about ICE and the technology it uses? We would love to learn how this affects you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email . You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop .\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, effectively reactivating the contract .\n\nAt this point, it’s unclear what’s the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Parago is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more .\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE . A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon , with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company Red Lattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist .\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists . In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records , LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to subscribe to the service.\n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with Palantir. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE , revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\n404 Media cited “a source familiar with the database,” who said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider . ImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired .\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Cybersecurity\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing lorenzo@techcrunch.com , via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase\/Telegram.\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

    "body":"Hike, once one of India’s most valuable startups with unicorn status, has become the latest casualty of New Delhi’s recent real-money gaming ban, with the company — led by Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel founder Sunil Bharti Mittal — now shutting down.\n\nOn Saturday, Hike founder Mittal (pictured above) said that the startup’s U.S. business, which launched nine months ago, was “off to a strong start.” But he said scaling it globally would require “a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time.”\n\nInitially launched as an instant messaging app rivaling WhatsApp in 2012, Hike pivoted to real-money gaming in recent years, with its primary platform, Rush, offering casual games like carrom and ludo for cash prizes, following the shutdown of Hike Messenger in 2021. Rush attracted over 10 million users and generated more than $500 million in gross revenue over its four-year run, Mittal said.\n\nStoried investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Tencent backed Hike’s early ambition to take on WhatsApp with a youth-focused messaging app. The startup was valued at $1.4 billion in 2016.\n\n“We could raise the capital, but the real question is: is it worth it? Is this a climb worth pivoting for?” Mittal wrote in a Substack post. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.”\n\nLast month, the Indian government shocked the $23-billion real-money gaming industry by introducing the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, which imposed a blanket ban on such platforms. The federal government said the decision was aimed at addressing incidents of harm, including cases where individuals reportedly died by suicide after losing money in these games.\n\nIn response, top industry players including Dream Sports and Mobile Premier League (MPL) began shutting down their real-money gaming operations in India. While some started pivoting to new ventures like micro-dramas and financial services , others began exploring international markets to keep parts of their gaming businesses alive.\n\nThe crackdown has also triggered a wave of layoffs, with around 2,000 job losses reported across companies like Games24x7 , Head Digital Works , MPL , and Zupee . Some of them are planning to cut up to 90% of their workforce as they attempt to adapt or exit the space, sources told TechCrunch.\n\nSome VC firms backing these startups have also questioned their founders on whether there had been any early signs of regulatory action — and if so, why no steps were taken to mitigate the impact, sources familiar with the conversations told TechCrunch.\n\nEarlier this week, the Indian Supreme Court transferred all petitions challenging the new law — the rules of which are yet to be notified — from multiple state courts across the country. However, the top court has yet to begin hearing the matter.\n\n“This is both a disappointment and a hard outcome. But I choose to look on the bright side: the learnings are invaluable, and my conviction for what’s next is even stronger,” Mittal wrote.\n\nTopics\n\nReporter\n\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

    "body":"The all-electric Ram 1500 REV pickup truck is dead. Long live the extended-range Ram 1500 REV (once called the Ramcharger).\n\nStellantis, the parent company of Ram, said Friday that it will no longer develop a battery-electric full-size pickup. The company cited low demand for full-size battery-electric trucks as the primary reason, according to a statement sent to TechCrunch and posted on its website .\n\n“As demand for full-size battery-electric trucks slows in North America, Stellantis is reassessing its product strategy and will discontinue development of a full-size BEV pickup,” the company’s statement reads. “As part of this, Ram is renaming its REEV-powered pickup to Ram 1500 REV (formerly Ramcharger). This vehicle will set a new benchmark in the half-ton segment, offering exceptional range, towing capability and payload performance.”\n\nIf the name swap is confusing, it’s because it is. But here is what’s worth knowing. Stellantis canceled plans to develop a battery electric pickup and will instead pursue an extended-range truck that gets an estimated 690 miles of range through a novel — but not unheard of — approach of combining a battery with a gas generator.\n\nThe Ram 1500 all-electric pickup was part of parent company Stellantis’ U.S. product offensive to sell more than 25 all-new BEVs by the end of the decade. But its future has been in question for months now.\n\nAfter a splashy reveal at CES 2023 , and other showcases in the months that followed, Stellantis wavered on its EV truck plans. Stellantis initially said it would begin producing the vehicle in 2024. That date soon slipped to 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Stellantis delayed plans to develop the broad-shouldered pickup loaded with tech, a longer cabin with third-row jump seats, and two massive and industry-busting battery pack options. At the time, Stellantis said it would push its launch into 2026.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson confirmed that the automaker still plans to begin production of the extended-range Ram 1500 in 2026.\n\nTopics\n\nTransportation Editor\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

    "title":"Via shrugs off tepid open to end first day of trading slightly above IPO price | TechCrunch",
    "body":"Investors took a cautious approach to transit software startup Via’s IPO on Friday, with shares opening below the company’s IPO price before recovering at the end of the day slightly higher.\n\nThe company, which initially filed confidentially for IPO in July, priced its IPO at $46 per share, raising $492.9 million. Those shares slipped to $44 when the stock began trading Friday afternoon, and then inched back into the green to finish at just over $49. The modest gain values Via at roughly $3.9 billion at the close of its first trading day.\n\nVia raised about $328 million in its IPO, while existing shareholders sold another $164 million worth of stock, bringing the total deal size to nearly $493 million.\n\n“We’re extremely pleased with the result of today’s IPO, and we think it is a testament to the value and durability of the company,” Via CEO Daniel Ramot said. “We are grateful for the feedback and support from our team, partners, and investors who made this milestone possible.”\n\nVia initially launched in 2012 by deploying Via-branded shuttles that users could hail. Over time, Via improved its on-demand routing algorithm, which uses real-time data to route microtransit shuttles to where they’re needed most. Now that tech is its core business, which it sells to 689 cities and transit agencies to power their microtransit.\n\nRamot told TechCrunch the company would use the proceeds to invest in growth, sales, and marketing. And maybe even an acquisition, in the future.\n\n“We’re not necessarily looking to raise funds to drive operations,” Ramot said. “There may be an opportunity for us to use the proceeds and the currency of a public stock to make some interesting acquisitions like we did with Remix and Citymapper.”\n\nVia acquired Remix for bus planning in 2021 , and Citymapper for journey planning in 2023. Ramot said he’s open to other complementary acquisitions, rather than acquisitions to gain market share.\n\nVia revenue has increased roughly 30% year-over-year. The company told TechCrunch that it expects to earn around $429 million in revenue in 2025, a projection based on its quarterly revenue times four.\n\nVia closed the first six months of 2025 with $205.7 million in revenue. But the company is still in the red, though that loss is shrinking. The first six months of 2025 ended at a loss of $37.5 million, down from $50.4 million the previous year.\n\nRamot said Via is close to profitability but declined to give specific projections.\n\nThe executive says Via’s growth is proof that government customers can sustain a lucrative business.\n\n“Most tech companies going public are not very focused on this sector, on helping local government,” he said, adding that the technology Via provides mainly benefits riders of microtransit and paratransit systems, the people who rely on buses to get around.\n\n“Low-income people, people with disabilities, students — those are the demographics that we typically support,” he said. “It’s really nice to see investors actually support that.”\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

    "title":"Why the Oracle-OpenAI deal caught Wall Street by surprise | TechCrunch",
    "body":"This week, OpenAI and Oracle shocked the markets with a surprise $300 billion, five-year agreement , part of a surge of new business that sent the cloud provider’s stock skyrocketing. But maybe the markets shouldn’t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle’s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.\n\nOn the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup’s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup’s appetite — even if it’s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.\n\nChirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it’s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company’s infrastructure — spreading out risk among several cloud providers — and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.\n\n“OpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,” Dekate said. “This is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.”\n\nSome industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company’s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn’t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok’s sizable U.S. business.\n\n“Over the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,” Dekate said.\n\nBut even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.\n\nOpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue , up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.\n\nPower is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.\n\nIndustry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear .\n\nDespite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI’s anticipated growth isn’t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.\n\nCompute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now ).\n\nBut compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms , buying nuclear power plants , and inking deals with geothermal startups .\n\nSo far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo , Helion , and Exowatt , but the company itself hasn’t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.\n\nWith a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.\n\nThe company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure — something it has extensive experience with — just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI’s future power needs. That will leave the company “asset light,” something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

(formerly Dotdash Meredith), a publisher that operates over 40 brands, including People, Food & Wine, Travel + Leisure, Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, Southern Living, Allrecipes, and others, said that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the Google search engine as it does to support its AI features.\n\n“Google has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,” said Vogel, speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week.\n\nHe noted that three years ago, Google Search accounted for about 65% of the company’s traffic and that has since dropped to the “high 20s.” (Vogel shared an even more startling statistic with AdExchanger last month, saying that as of several years ago, Google’s traffic accounted for as much as 90% of People Inc.’s traffic from the open web.)\n\n“I’m not complaining. We’ve grown our audience. We’ve grown our revenue,” Vogel told conference attendees. “We’re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.”\n\nVogel believes publishers need more leverage in the AI era, which is why he feels it’s necessary to block AI crawlers — automated programs that scan websites to train AI systems — as that can force them into content deals. His company, for example, has a deal with OpenAI, which Vogel described as a “good actor.”\n\nPeople Inc. has been leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare’s latest solution to block AI crawlers that don’t pay, prompting AI players to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While Vogel wouldn’t directly name the companies involved, he said they were “large LLM providers.” No deals have been signed yet, but Vogel said the company is “much further along” than before it adopted the crawler-blocking solution.\n\nHowever, Vogel pointed out, Google’s crawler can’t be blocked because doing so would also prevent the publisher’s websites from being indexed in Google Search, cutting off that “20%-ish” of traffic that Google still delivers.\n\n“They know this, and they’re not splitting their crawler. So they are an intentional bad actor here,” Vogel declared.\n\nJanice Min, the editor-in-chief and CEO at newsletter provider Ankler Media , agreed, calling Big Tech companies like Google and Meta longtime “content kleptomaniacs.”\n\n“I don’t see the benefit to us in partnering with any AI company right now,” she said, adding that her company blocks AI crawlers.\n\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, whose company makes the AI-blocking solution (and who was also on the panel), said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the AI companies behave. He suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations.\n\nThe Cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the AI companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law, created for the pre-AI era, was the right answer.\n\n“I think that it’s a fool’s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it’s protected under fair use … What these AI companies are doing is they’re actually creating derivatives,” Prince said. “And so if you look at the best case law that’s come out so far, it’s actually said that the use by Anthropic and others — the reason Anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for $1.5 billion — was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got.”\n\nPrince also proclaimed that “everything that’s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google’s fault,” because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation, triggering publishers like BuzzFeed to write for clicks. Still, he admitted that Google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint.\n\n“Internally, they’re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models,” he said.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

    "title":"Micro1, a competitor to Scale AI, raises funds at $500M valuation | TechCrunch",
    "body":"Micro1, a three-year-old startup that helps AI companies find and manage human contractors for data labeling and training, has raised a $35 million Series A funding round that values the company at $500 million. The round was led by 01 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, the former CEO and COO of Twitter.\n\nThe startup is one of many companies looking to fill the gap in the data market created by recent changes involving Scale AI. After Meta invested $14 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, AI labs, including OpenAI and Google , said they planned to cut ties with the startup, presumably over concerns that their research could end up in Meta’s hands. (Scale AI denies that it shares confidential information with Meta as part of its partnership.)\n\nHowever, AI labs still need these data services, and startups like Micro1 aim to pick up the slack.\n\nMicro1 CEO Ali Ansari — who is just 24 years old — tells TechCrunch that his company has been working with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. Ansari said Micro1 is now generating $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up from $7 million at the start of 2025.\n\nThat’s still a far cry from larger competitors like Mercor, which is generating more than $450 million in ARR, and Surge, which reportedly brought in $1.2 billion in 2024 . However, Micro1’s growth and adoption among AI labs seems to be growing at a healthy rate.\n\nAs part of the new funding, Micro1 is also adding Bain to its board of directors, alongside Joshua Browder, founder and CEO of the AI legal assistant DoNotPay.\n\n“Really the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I’ve never seen before,” Bain said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\nReuters previously reported details of Micro1’s fundraising efforts.\n\nAll these companies — Micro1, Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI — supply AI labs with access to a large base of human contractors who can label and generate data for AI training. It’s become a crucial service that companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google need to build cutting-edge AI models.\n\nScale AI was first to dominate this space, with the initial insight that it could pay relatively little for low-skilled contractors around the world to help label data for AI model training. However, Ansari says that the demands of AI labs have shifted in recent years and that companies now need high-quality data labeling from domain experts — such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers — to improve their AI models. The hard part became recruiting these types of folks.\n\nThis led Micro1 to build its AI recruiter, Zara, which interviews and vets candidates who apply to work as one of the company’s contractors, or as Ansari calls them, experts. Micro1 says Zara has recruited thousands of experts — including professors from Stanford and Harvard — and that the company plans to add hundreds more every week.\n\nThe market for AI training data appears to be changing yet again. Now, many AI labs are interested in working with startups to develop “environments” — virtual workspaces that can be used to train AI agents on simulated tasks. Ansari says Micro1 is building new offerings in the environments space to meet this demand.\n\nLuckily for startups like Micro1, AI labs seem to be working with multiple training data providers. The nature of the business is such that it’s difficult for any one company to handle all of one AI lab’s data needs. That means there’s plenty of business to go around, at least for now.\n\nTopics\n\nSenior AI Reporter\n\nMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI.

    "body":"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification.\n\nIt’s a potentially big change for these companies, as they’ve spent the last few years performing limited test flights of their aircraft while working toward FAA approval. But the program has its limits.\n\nCompanies will have to partner with state, local, tribal, or territorial governments to apply to the program. The FAA says it will approve at least five projects that can run for up to three years, covering short-range air taxis, longer-range fixed wing flights, cargo hauling, logistics and supply for emergency or medical purposes, and “increasing automation safety.”\n\nThe FAA is seeking applicants “who can deliver successful outcomes by working cooperatively with a range of entities, which will accelerate these projects consistent with the high safety standards that the public expects from the aviation industry,” according to the official solicitation paperwork .\n\n“These projects, once successful, are expected to deliver substantial data and lessons learned to inform the broader regulatory framework that will support and oversee the AAM [advanced air mobility] sector,” the agency writes.\n\nSo far on Friday, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have announced that they plan to apply to the pilot program. Neither company has said which government entity they plan to apply with, though Archer noted it will work with existing partner (and investor) United Airlines. Applications are due on December 11, 2025, and the pilots might begin as soon as 2026.\n\nTopics\n\nSr. Reporter, Transportation\n\nSean O’Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

    "title":"Mastodon rolls out quote posts with protections to prevent 'dunking' | TechCrunch",
    "body":"Mastodon, an open source, decentralized alternative to X, is rolling out a somewhat controversial feature by adding quote posts, which will launch next week. The feature, which allows a user to quote someone else’s post and reshare it with their own response or commentary, has contributed to a culture of “ dunking ” on X, where users often deride other people by responding with snark or insulting humor.\n\nTo address this concern, Mastodon says it’s implementing quote posts with safety controls.\n\nThese protections are designed to allow quote posts to be used responsibly, to “expand discussions, make new connections, and amplify underrepresented voices,” the platform states.\n\nMastodon gives users several ways to control how their posts can be quoted. For starters, the platform lets users decide who can quote them through a setting where you can change your defaults. Here, you can set the permissions for who can quote you by choosing between “Anyone,” “Followers only,” or “Just me.” Additionally, you can control the visibility of quote posts by setting them to be visible to the public, to followers only, or a setting called “quiet public,” which makes the quotes public but removes them from Mastodon’s search, trends, and public timeline.\n\nUsers will also be able to override their default settings on a post-by-post basis, if need be, by navigating to the “Visibility and interaction settings” within the composer screen. This would be useful if you know you’re about to say something controversial or anything that could attract unwanted attention from those with opposing views, for instance.\n\nPlus, users will have control of their posts even after they’re quoted, the Mastodon blog post about the new feature explains.\n\nWhen someone quotes a post, the user being quoted is notified in the app, and they can choose to remove their original post from the other person’s quote post. This is accessible through the Options menu (the three dots icon). From this location, users can change the quote settings to address any future quoting of their post going forward. They can also block users to prevent them from seeing and quoting their posts in the future.\n\nSupport for quote posts will first arrive over the week ahead to the larger Mastodon servers at mastodon.online and mastodon.social . It will then become available in Mastodon’s 4.5 software update.\n\nTo quote a post, you’ll find the new option under Mastodon’s Boost (similar to X’s repost\/retweet feature). Because the fediverse, or open social web, is a network of servers running different software, quote posts may not immediately appear everywhere, and some platforms may not update to use the technical specification enabling quote post support right away.\n\nTopics\n\nConsumer News Editor\n\nFounders: land your investor and sharpen your pitch.

    "title":"Exclusive: How an over-the-air update made Quilt’s heat pumps more powerful | TechCrunch",
    "body":"Software might be eating the world, but it’s taking some industries longer than others to realize its full potential.\n\nFrom iPhones to Teslas, people have grown accustomed to software updates improving the stuff they already own. But outside consumer electronics and automobiles , over-the-air updates aren’t commonplace yet.\n\nYet that’s beginning to change, starting with an unlikely product: heat pumps. Last week, heat pump startup Quilt said that it pushed an update last week to heat pumps already installed in customers’ homes. It wasn’t just a bug fix either: The new software and firmware boosted the units’ heating and cooling capacities overnight by more than 20%.\n\n“From the very beginning, we wanted to design the systems to be able to be continuously improved, updated over the air. It’s a pattern that’s happened in EVs and gotten a lot of traction, but no one had really done that before in HVAC,” Quilt CEO Paul Lambert told TechCrunch.\n\n“In cars, sometimes they call it software-defined vehicles. We feel like we’ve created software-defined HVAC,” he added.\n\nIt can be hard to prove a negative, but according to heat pump expert Drew Tozer , the update is likely the first of its kind. Typically, when a heat pump is installed — or any piece of HVAC equipment — the only time it’s touched is when there’s a problem.\n\nBut many on Quilt’s team didn’t come from a traditional HVAC background. Instead, they were drawn from Nest , Google, Apple, and Tesla, companies where frequent updates are the norm. Isaac McQuillen, the engineer who led the capacity increase project, worked most recently at Lucid Motors, where he managed heating and cooling for both passengers and batteries.\n\n“We got some feedback from both [installation] partners and some customers that it’d be really useful if we were able to have a slightly higher maximum operating capacity,” McQuillen said. Some people had larger living rooms or open floorpans that were more demanding. So the team dug in to see if the heat pumps had a little extra to give.\n\nQuilt had specified more and higher quality sensors than what is normally found in residential HVAC systems, including additional pressures sensors, higher accuracy temperature and current sensors, McQuillen said. That data was key to the project.\n\nOnce the team realized they had room to spare, they set about testing the new parameters on in-house units to validate both performance and reliability. Quilt’s updates included both software and firmware that runs on the main processor and microcontrollers scattered throughout the indoor and outdoor units.\n\nOriginally installed, the outdoor portion of a Quilt heat pump provided up to 19,700 BTUs of cooling per hour and 20,500 BTUs of heating per hour. Now cooling and heating figures have increased to 24,000 BTUs per hour and 25,200 BTUs per hour, respectively.\n\nThe new ratings don’t change how efficiently the heat pumps run, but it does allow them to better cope with extreme heat and cold.\n\nThe power of over-the-air updating doesn’t come for free. It was only possible because Quilt had used higher quality sensors, monitored the data more closely, and included networking equipment to receive the update. They added a small amount to the total bill of materials, Lambert said. But as the company sees it, the benefits far outweigh the costs. “There’s the upfront capital cost of the sensors, but we think there’s just so much value to be gained from that extra data that that we felt that was worth it to integrate them,” McQuillen said.\n\n”The hard part,” Lambert added, ”is knowing how to build all the integration around it with the software and all the systems working together.”\n\nPlus, Quilt can now sell the units to a broader range of customers without having to design and market an entirely new model. Sounds like a win-win.\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Climate\n\nTim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

    "body":"Thanks to a pledge to unbundle its corporate messaging app Teams from its productivity suites, Microsoft has managed to slip unscathed through a major antitrust investigation by the European Commission that could have resulted in massive fines for the tech giant.\n\nThe Commission on Friday okayed Microsoft’s concessions to address the EU’s competition concerns over the company including Teams along with the rest of its Office productivity suite for free, concluding a multi-year investigation that was sparked by complaints from rival office messaging app Slack in 2020.\n\nMicrosoft has promised that for the next seven years, it will provide Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams at a lower price and will let customers choose whether they want to pay more to add the collaboration app to the suites.\n\nThe Commission has also managed to get Microsoft to agree to open up its APIs to enable interoperability for key features between its suite and third-party messaging and collaboration tools, as well as let them export their data out of teams for the next five years.\n\nIn its investigation, the European authority accused Microsoft of breaching competition rules by bundling teams with its productivity suites, abusing its dominant position and granting Teams an undue advantage. In its preliminary findings, the Commission also said that advantage was improved because Teams was integrated with other Microsoft 365 apps like Excel, Outlook, SharePoint, and Word.\n\nMicrosoft attempted to allay those concerns by implementing a partial unbundling of Teams in April 2024, but the Commission felt more extensive changes were needed, following which the company offered a revised plan in May 2025.\n\nThis approval is a win-win for both the EU and Microsoft, especially because there was no legal battle. The Commission can say it’s wrung a big compromise from Big Tech. Now Microsoft is voluntarily offering some versions of both its productivity suites without Teams at a 50% lower price compared to versions that bundle the app, worldwide .\n\nAnd Microsoft dodged punitive measures and a big fine, as the Commission’s penalties for breaching competition rules can reach up to 10% of annual global revenue — which, considering the tech giant last year recorded $245 billion in revenue, would have been truckloads of money.\n\n“We appreciate the dialogue with the Commission that led to this agreement, and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully,” Nanna-Louise Linde, vice president of European Government Affairs at Microsoft, said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Commission also noted that Slack and Alfaview, another company that had complained about Teams, have withdrawn their complaints following a market test by the Commission earlier this year.\n\n“With today’s decision, we make binding for seven years or more Microsoft’s commitments to put an end to its tying practices that may be preventing rivals from effectively competing with Teams,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement.\n\n“Today’s decision therefore opens up competition in this crucial market, and ensures that businesses can freely choose the communication and collaboration product that best suits their needs,” said Ribera.\n\nNote: This story was updated to add a comment by Microsoft.\n\nTopics\n\nEditor\n\nRam is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

    "title":"We are entering a golden age of robotics startups — and not just because of AI | TechCrunch",
    "body":"When Seth Winterroth left his job at GE Ventures to help launch Eclipse in 2015, robotics was on his mind. Or more specifically, the number of early-stage robotics startups that were struggling to launch due to lack of interest.\n\n“These are teams that had just finished their postdocs at Waterloo, or CMU, or MIT and were starting robotics companies, and the refrain that I continually heard from the startups was, ‘Hey, we’re having a really hard time raising institutional venture capital,’” Winterroth told TechCrunch. “At the time in Silicon Valley, most venture capital was going into the very mature application layer or the application layer of some very mature computing platforms.”\n\nA lot has changed since then.\n\nNow, after investing in robotics startups for 10 years, Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said the time to invest in robotics has never been better. The robotics startup market has matured and the hardware and software powering these bots has gotten significantly better — and cheaper.\n\nVenture investing in the category is gaining momentum as well. Investors poured $6 billion into robotics startups in the first seven months of 2025 according to Crunchbase data . The data company predicts that this year’s funding totals will eclipse 2024, making it one of the only non-AI categories to experience a boost in funding.\n\nWhile one could argue that robotics is seeing a surge in investor interest because of AI — and it’s not wrong to acknowledge AI’s role in the advancement of robotic tech — investors who have focused on the category longer than the last few years said the industry didn’t get to this point just because of advancements in AI over the past few years.\n\nThe real catalyst for the industry to start gaining momentum actually happened back in 2012, Winterroth said, when Kiva Systems, a small startup based out of Massachusetts, got acquired by Amazon.\n\n“I like to say Kiva Systems’ acquisition was the acquisition that launched 1,000 robotic startups,” Winterroth said. “Between 2011 and 2015, 2016, that really was the case. You just saw a number of different new companies get started. Some like 6 River Systems, or Clearpath Robotics, were successful, but most were not. But that talent learns and that learning compounds, and it’s brought into the next set of ventures.”\n\nThis first wave helped attract engineers to the sector and helped companies figure out product-market-fit, he said.\n\nKira Noodleman, a partner at Bee Partners, echoed this. Noodleman told TechCrunch the last decade of trial and error helped startups figure out what the market is actually looking for when it comes to robotics and automation.\n\nSome companies, like Rapid Robotics, which Noodleman backed, shut down trying to figure out what the market wanted. Those failures have helped the next batch of startup founders, who now have a much better idea of what potential customers want from this sector.\n\nNoodleman had a similar experience with her own investing thesis, she said, which changed as the market matured.\n\n“Lights out manufacturing assumes there are zero humans in the loop; that is just not happening. We proved that already back in the 2010s,” Noodleman said. “Let me take a simple task, machine tending, all it is is someone’s hand putting something in and out of a machine. The point here is you can imagine how many low-hanging fruit, repetitive tasks there are, like machine tending.”\n\nFady Saad, a general partner at early-stage robotics-focused Cybernetix Ventures, also launched his firm prior to the AI boom after he noticed he was spending a lot of time connecting early-stage robotics companies to sources of funding during his time as a co-founder at MassRobotics.\n\nFalling hardware costs have also driven investor interest in the sector, Saad said, noting that it’s cheaper to build robots today than five years ago. This allows companies to have a more viable path to scale and makes them more attractive to potential venture backers.\n\n“The cost of building robotics has been going dramatically down,” Saad said. “Advances in sensor technology, compute, and batteries, all of that, it was the perfect timing to start full-stack robotics solutions.”\n\nAdvancements in AI aren’t hurting the industry either. While AI is being touted by many as the main reason why robotics are starting to see an increase in interest — alongside an Elon Musk-driven fascination with humanoid robots — it isn’t the only factor.\n\nSaad added that while AI and large language models can be helpful for training robots, these LLMs are primarily trained on online information, whereas robots interact with the real world.\n\nThere are companies building models based on that real-life data; Nvidia just released a new set of world models for robot training in August. But Saad predicted it will take a bit longer to capture and train robots, especially those that will exist alongside people, on world data.\n\nMomentum in the industry may be starting to swell, but that doesn’t mean every startup has figured out the best approach yet. Nor are some categories within robotics as mature as others.\n\nSome of the first few markets to adopt robotics and automation, including manufacturing, warehousing, and construction, continue to be attractive for robotics startup backers.\n\nFor Winterroth, Saad, and Noodleman, healthcare and surgical-related robots remain a compelling area to invest in too. Noodleman adds eldercare to that category as well.\n\n“In-home assistance is interesting, coming from me having looked at industrial robotics for 10 years,” Noodleman said. “Manufacturing and mining, burning labor shortages, aging populations, no humans are available at any price, even imperfect robotics are better than nothing.”\n\nSaad added that vertically focused robotics companies tend to have access to more real-world and physical data, too, than horizontal players.\n\nOne area that these VCs are not as excited about are humanoids or consumer — and especially not consumer-focused humanoids.\n\nSaad isn’t convinced that people will want to have a robot in their house anytime soon. He added that even non-humanoid consumer-focused robotics companies have struggled to get consumers excited.\n\n“The only successful consumer robot company, iRobot, failed to come up with a second act,” Saad said. “Pool cleaning robot, lawn mower, mopping and floor-cleaning robot, none of these worked out for whatever reason.”\n\nWhile the industry is still years away from commercial success of more intricate robotic models, like humanoids, VCs are pouring more capital into the sector. Despite the fact that this interest is driving up the costs of deals, the surge in interest is a net positive for the industry, Winterroth and Saad said, as the potential customer base for robotics startups continues to grow.\n\n“There are enough examples of successful commercial organizations, successful robotics companies, that have become a valuable commercial organization,” Winterroth said. “Ten, 15 years ago, it was questionable whether or not there was going to be a large and thriving marketplace for these types of solutions. Now there’s a lot of customer awareness.”\n\nTopics\n\nSenior Reporter, Venture\n\nBecca is a senior writer at TechCrunch that covers venture capital trends and startups.

I believe it’s now complete.\n\nThe goal has been to design, build, and ship an AI-first database that redefines retrieval for AI.\n\nMeridianDB goes beyond semantic meaning — adding temporal, contextual, and behavioral dimensions — and aims to solve catastrophic forgetting , striking a better balance between stability and plasticity.\n\n📄 First Iteration: Fixing AI Amnesia: MeridianDB’s Answer to Costly Training and Memory Loss\n\nAfter three more iterations, the vision is now solid. I know what I can ship within the next three weeks, and I’ve made major architectural changes to the database.\n\nLet’s ground the work and ship by Oct 7 .\n\nThe most common solution today is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) — a technique that enhances LLMs by fetching external, up-to-date, domain-specific data before generating a response.\n\nMeridianDB takes this further, expanding the dimensions of meaning for agents:\n\nSemantic Features: Same as RAG — the agent retrieves relevant contextual data via semantic search. Temporal Features: Goes beyond simple time-range queries:\n\nContextual Features: Includes user environment, task descriptions, goals — whatever context the developer thinks the agent needs to perform optimally.\n\nRAG pipelines are powerful but bring several challenges:\n\nMeridianDB addresses these issues out of the box , while pushing retrieval innovation forward.\n\n1–2) Human clients: one driven by app logic, one for DB operators. 3) Worker API gateway: handles requests from both clients and SDK integrations. 4) Eventual consistency model : write operations are queued, simplifying retries and error handling while following Cloudflare’s consistency model. 5–8) Queues publish write events consumed by workers for vectorization and D1. 9) Retrieval engine: performs multi-dimensional queries for the AI agent. 10–14) Behavioral logging: tracks agent performance on tasks, creating a feedback loop for improvement.\n\nQueue-based architecture ensures eventual consistency without developer orchestration of multiple datastores. This reduces overhead and eliminates ghost embeddings.\n\nData is stored redundantly (vector + D1) to maintain its multidimensional context — a tradeoff made deliberately for reliability.\n\nNo need to glue together multiple systems. MeridianDB comes with a built-in operator interface for observability — critical for debugging agent behavior and improving performance over time.\n\nBehavioral logging allows for continuous improvement — even continuous learning in the future. You can measure whether retrieved context led to task success or failure through continuously updated decision trees.\n\nReads may lag slightly behind writes. Read-after-write guarantees may need replicas or caching strategies.\n\nDevelopers must provide contextual features (task description, environment, etc.). Future iterations could offload this to an agent that auto-generates context.\n\nTemporal decay means data needs periodic cleanup. This can be handled with background jobs.\n\nMeridianDB introduces new mental models (temporal, semantic, behavioral, contextual). Developers familiar with basic RAG pipelines may need time to adapt. The SDK is designed to hide most of this complexity, exposing only three core methods: store, retrieve, log .\n\nCloudflare-native architecture delivers great performance — but ties you to that ecosystem.",

    "body":"This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge\n\nI built Crystal Vision AI .\n\nMy goal wasn't just to create another image generator. I wanted to build an experience .\n\nA magical portal where your ideas and photos are transformed into mystical works of art.\n\nCrystal Vision AI solves a simple problem: How can we make AI art generation more personal and enchanting?\n\nIt does this in two powerful ways:\n\nEnchant an Image: You can upload your own photo—of your pet, a friend, or a favorite object. Then, you provide a text prompt to magically edit it. The AI understands both the image and your words to create something entirely new.\n\nSummon a Vision: For moments of pure imagination, you can simply describe a scene. The AI acts as your personal oracle, conjuring a stunning, photorealistic image from your words alone.\n\nThe core magic?\n\nEvery creation is beautifully and seamlessly encapsulated within a glowing, hyper-realistic crystal ball , turning every generation into a unique, mystical artifact.\n\nIt's a tool designed to spark joy, unleash creativity, and make you feel like a real magician.\n\nBehold the magic in action!\n\n🔮 Live Applet Link: Experience Crystal Vision AI Here!\n\nHere's a glimpse into the visual journey:\n\nUsers are greeted by an ethereal, animated interface that immediately sets a magical tone.\n\nHere, a user has uploaded a photo of their cat and is adding a prompt to give it a sparkling crown. Notice the simple, intuitive controls.\n\nAfter a moment of 'consulting the oracle,' the final vision is revealed—a breathtaking image, perfectly rendered inside the crystal ball.\n\nGoogle AI Studio was my digital alchemy lab. It was the crucial first step where I prototyped, tested, and truly understood the capabilities of the Gemini models before writing a single line of production code.\n\nMy two key ingredients were:\n\ngemini-2.5-flash-image-preview : This was the absolute star of the show . Its powerful multimodal capabilities are the engine behind the \"Enchant an Image\" feature. I used the Studio to test how the model would interpret an uploaded image alongside a text prompt.\n\nimagen-4.0-generate-001 : This model is a pure powerhouse for text-to-image generation. It's the oracle that powers the \"Summon a Vision\" feature, creating stunningly detailed images from just a description.\n\nMy process involved countless iterations in the Studio to perfect the prompts. I fine-tuned phrases like \"hyper-realistic, glowing crystal ball\" and \"sitting on a dark, mystical surface\" to achieve the exact aesthetic I envisioned. This rapid prototyping saved hours of development time and ensured the final app produced consistently magical results.\n\nThe soul of Crystal Vision AI lies in its multimodal functionality.\n\nSpecifically, in the Enchant an Image mode.\n\nThis isn't just a simple image filter. It's a true creative conversation with the AI. The model processes two distinct types of information simultaneously:\n\nVisual Input: The user's uploaded image. The AI doesn't just see pixels; it gains a contextual understanding of the subject and composition of the photo.\n\nTextual Input: The user's typed command. This is where the user directs the magic, asking for specific changes like \"add a wizard hat\" or \"make it look like it's made of stars.\"\n\nThe model then fuses these two inputs. It intelligently identifies the main subject from the image and applies the textual command to it, before reimagining the entire scene within the crystal ball theme.\n\nWhy does this enhance the user experience?\n\nIt makes the creation process deeply personal and interactive .\n\nUsers aren't just passive prompters; they are active collaborators with the AI. They can bring their own life and memories—their pets, their friends, their art—into the magical world.\n\nThis transforms the app from a simple generator into a powerful, personal creative companion. It's the profound difference between asking an AI to create a dragon , and asking it to give your beloved pet lizard a pair of majestic, fiery wings.\n\nThat is the magic of multimodality. And that is the magic of Crystal Vision AI .",

    "title":"Understanding Process Management in Linux: A Deep Dive for Developers and Admins 💻",
    "body":"Process management is a fundamental skill for anyone working on Linux. It's the art of controlling and monitoring the programs that run on your system. Whether you're a developer debugging a runaway script or a system administrator optimizing server performance, understanding how to manage processes is key. In this guide, we'll go beyond the basics and explore the most powerful commands and their practical applications.\n\nWhat is a Process? 🧠 At its core, a process is a running instance of a program. When you type a command and hit enter, the Linux kernel creates a new process for it. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) and a Parent Process ID (PPID), which establishes a clear parent-child relationship.\n\nProcess States : A process can be in several states, including:\n\nEssential Commands & Practical Examples\n\n1. ps: The Process Snapshot 📸\n\nThe ps command is your go-to for a quick snapshot of current processes. While a simple ps will only show processes in the current terminal, using options unlocks its true power.\n\nps aux : This is one of the most common and useful variants.\n\nps -ef : Another popular option for a full, comprehensive listing.\n\nExample : To find all processes owned by the user john and display them in a full format: ps -u john -f\n\n2. top: The Real-Time Task Manager 📈\n\nThe top command provides a dynamic, real-time view of your system's processes. It's like a command-line version of a task manager, showing you which processes are consuming the most CPU and memory.\n\nInteractive Commands within top :\n\nPro-tip : While top is powerful, consider using htop if it's available. htop is a modern, more user-friendly alternative with a color-coded interface and mouse support.\n\n3. kill & killall: The Process Terminators 💀\n\nSometimes, a process misbehaves, and you need to end it. The kill and killall commands are designed for this.\n\nSignals to know:\n\n4. pgrep & pkill: The Smart Killers 🎯\n\nThese commands allow you to work with processes by name, not just by PID . They are often used in scripts.\n\n5. nice & renice: Managing Process Priority ⚖️\n\nThe niceness value of a process determines its scheduling priority. A \"nice\" process is one that plays well with others and gives up CPU time. The niceness value ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).\n\n6. jobs, fg, & bg: Managing Background & Foreground Jobs 🏃\n\nIn a shell session, you can run commands in the background or suspend them.\n\nReady to put these commands into practice? What's one process management task you're looking to tackle today?",

    "body":"Tired of jerky robot movements and inefficient path planning? Imagine a world where robots glide effortlessly, adapting smoothly to dynamic environments. We've been wrestling with these challenges and discovered a game-changing approach to motion planning.\n\nThe core idea: representing motion as a dynamic flow field governed by a powerful mathematical operator. This field guides the robot from any starting point towards a desired trajectory, ensuring it not only follows the path but also smoothly converges to the final destination. The secret sauce? Crafting these flow fields to be almost divergence-free, guaranteeing smooth, predictable, and stable movements.\n\nThink of it like water flowing towards a drain. We're sculpting the landscape of the flow so that the water (our robot) naturally gravitates towards the drain (the goal) without creating chaotic whirlpools (unstable movements).\n\nHere's what makes this a game-changer:\n\nOne implementation challenge is the computational complexity of calculating these flow fields in real-time, especially for high-dimensional robots. A practical tip: leverage pre-computed flow fields for common scenarios and use interpolation techniques for novel situations to significantly reduce runtime.\n\nThis approach opens exciting possibilities for a wide range of applications. Imagine drones navigating complex airspace with unparalleled precision, or robotic arms performing intricate assembly tasks with unmatched dexterity. Beyond robotics, this technique could revolutionize character animation in games and virtual reality, bringing unprecedented realism to virtual movements.\n\nWe are on the cusp of a new era in motion planning, where robots move with grace, efficiency, and adaptability. This is just the beginning, and we're excited to see where this research takes us.\n\nRelated Keywords: Koopman Operator, Flow Fields, Divergence-Free Fields, Motion Planning, Path Planning, Trajectory Optimization, Robotics, Autonomous Navigation, Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, AI, Control Theory, Dynamical Systems, Simulation, Robot Learning, Agile Robotics, Swarm Robotics, Drone Navigation, Virtual Reality, Game AI, Collision Avoidance, Robotic Arm Control",

    "body":"This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge\n\nI built SpiritDex , an explorer's journal that transforms the entire world into a canvas for discovery. It's a web application where users can explore any real-world location on a map, scan for spiritual energy, and discover unique AI-generated \"spirits.\"\n\nEach spirit is procedurally generated by the Gemini API, with its name, lore, appearance, and stats inspired by the genuine history, folklore, and mythology of the chosen location. This creates an endlessly replayable and deeply personal collection experience. You aren't just collecting monsters; you're uncovering the hidden stories of places, given form and life by AI.\n\nThe app solves the problem of generic content in collection games by grounding every single creation in authentic, verifiable real-world lore, making each discovery feel meaningful and unique to the player's journey.\n\nTry the applet live here: https:\/\/spiritdex-25956270103.us-west1.run.app\/\n\nHere's a walkthrough of the core user journey:\n\nExplore & Discover: The user finds a location on the map, like the Tower of London, and scans for spirits.\n\nUncover an Echo: A mysterious clue and a hazy image appear, hinting at a spirit of a specific rarity.\n\nReveal & Collect: The user spends energy to reveal the spirit. Gemini generates its full lore, stats, and a unique portrait.\n\nCreate a Personal Encounter: The user can then take a photo and use the \"Create Encounter\" feature. The AI seamlessly edits the spirit into their photo, creating a personal, shareable memory.\n\nBuild Your Journal: Every spirit is added to the user's journal and deck, where they can read its history, add personal notes, and even chat with it.\n\nGoogle AI Studio was instrumental for prototyping and refining the complex, multi-step prompts that power SpiritDex. I heavily relied on it to test different model configurations and system instructions to achieve the desired tone and data structure.\n\nThe app is built entirely on the capabilities of the Gemini API:\n\ngemini-2.5-flash : This is the workhorse of the app. It handles:\n\nimagen-4.0-generate-001 : This model is responsible for giving the spirits visual form. It generates the primary spirit portraits and the artistic \"journal illustrations\" based on detailed textual descriptions created by gemini-2.5-flash .\n\ngemini-2.5-flash-image-preview : This powerful image editing model is the magic behind the \"Create Encounter\" feature, allowing for sophisticated image-and-text-to-image generation.\n\nSpiritDex is built from the ground up on multimodality, weaving different models and inputs together to create an immersive experience.\n\nThis is the core of the app. Instead of just asking the AI to \"make up a spirit,\" I use a two-step process to ensure quality and authenticity:\n\nOnce a spirit's data (including a detailed visual description) is generated, that description is passed to imagen-4.0-generate-001 . The prompt is specifically engineered to produce a \"found footage\" aesthetic (harsh flash, high ISO noise, motion blur), making the spirits feel more mysterious and grounded, as if they were captured by an amateur explorer. This directly translates the AI's textual idea into a compelling visual.\n\nThis is my favorite feature. A user uploads their own photo and selects a spirit. The app then sends the user's image along with a detailed text prompt to gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview . This prompt instructs the model to:\n\nThis creates a brand new, composite image that looks like a genuine snapshot of a supernatural encounter, providing a deeply personal and shareable piece of content that connects the user directly to their discovery.\n\nTo enhance the exploration fantasy, users can upload a photo of a landmark. The app uses gemini-2.5-flash 's vision capabilities to analyze the image, identify the location, and provide its name (e.g., \"Eiffel Tower, Paris, France\"). This text output is then used to automatically search for that location on the map, providing a fun, alternative way to begin the discovery process.",

    "title":"Optimizing Next.js Internationalization with URL-Based Locales",
    "body":"In this blog post, I want to talk about the process of optimizing locale handling in a Next.js application. Our initial implementation relied on a cookie-based approach for internationalization, which forced dynamic rendering and reduced both performance and SEO effectiveness.\n\nMigrating to a locale-based routing strategy , where the locale is embedded directly in the URL path (e.g., \/en\/about , \/ja\/about ), enabled Next.js to pre-render locale-specific routes at build time. This restored the benefits of static site generation (SSG), resulting in faster load times and improved SEO.\n\nEmbedding the locale directly into the URL path solves these challenges. Each locale-specific path becomes a static route that can be pre-rendered at build time. For instance, \/en\/about and \/ja\/about are treated as distinct static pages, each with its respective translations.\n\nThis approach simplifies navigation logic and enhances SEO. URLs are shareable and bookmarkable with the correct language context, and search engines can index each locale individually, improving discoverability.\n\nWe can achieve this cleanly by separating our next-intl configuration into dedicated files.\n\nFirst, we create a central configuration file to define our locales and their names. This promotes code reusability and makes it easy to add or remove languages in the future.\n\nNext, we define our routing strategy. By setting localePrefix: 'never' , we explicitly tell next-intl that we are handling the locale prefixes ourselves through the Next.js [locale] dynamic segment. This prevents next-intl from adding an extra prefix to our URLs.\n\nNote: The localePrefix option controls whether the locale appears in the URL path:\n\nChoosing the right option depends on whether URL-based SEO and shareable links for each locale are important.\n\nWe then use our defined routing configuration to create custom navigation helpers. This ensures that every time we use Link , useRouter , or other navigation functions, they automatically respect our locale-based routing setup.\n\nThe request.ts file handles the server-side logic for fetching locale-specific data. We use getRequestConfig to determine the correct locale from the request and load the corresponding message files. The hasLocale helper function is crucial here to ensure a valid locale is being requested, falling back to the defaultLocale if not.\n\nOur root layout handles the foundational setup for every page. We use setRequestLocale(locale) to tell next-intl to use the locale from the URL. This allows Next.js to leverage static rendering because the locale is known at the time of the request. The hasLocale check also helps us catch invalid locales and serve a notFound() page.\n\nThis component provides a user-friendly way to change the language. It uses the custom useRouter and usePathname from our navigation.ts file. When the user selects a new locale, the router.push call automatically updates the URL path to reflect the new language, e.g., from \/en\/about to \/ja\/about .\n\nA catch-all route ensures consistent handling of invalid URLs or unsupported locales:\n\nBy moving from a cookie-based locale system to URL-based routing , static site generation is fully restored while keeping internationalization seamless and SEO-friendly. The modular structure simplifies adding new locales, ensures consistent routing, and improves overall application performance.",

    "title":"How a 2020 Rolex Collection Changed the Face of Watch Design",
    "body":"As the company that either invented or popularized the dive watch, the GMT watch, the first water-resistant watch, the first automatic watches, and much more besides, you could hardly downplay Rolex ’s influence on watchmaking history. But while its iconic sports watches, like the Submariner , Daytona and GMT-Master are endlessly imitated, Rolex is not seen as a trendsetter, preferring to ignore passing horological fashions. It does its own thing, iterating carefully and minimally on its age-old templates.\n\nFive years ago, however, Rolex introduced a collection so avant-garde that is still influencing creative decisions across the entire watch industry, and it did so in one of its least-heralded models: the Oyster Perpetual . The idea was so simple that we’ve barely noticed it become the industry norm: Instead of slowly rolling out new dial colours one at a time over a period of years—which was standard watch world behavior until that point—Rolex launched a whole set of colored dials in a complementary palette all at once.\n\nThe 2020 multi-color Oyster Perpetual collection that started the wave of watch-world bright dials.\n\nThey were bright, bold and almost childlike in their purity: coral red, green, turquoise, pink and yellow. Rolex-watchers immediately hailed them as a tribute to the so-called Stella dial Day-Date watches of the late 1970s and 1980s—equally bright and unexpected, and evocative of a louche, sybaritic age. But there was something more basic, more essential and, at least theoretically, more attainable about the Oyster Perpetual collection.\n\nIt sparked imitators left, right and center—and still does. At last week's Geneva Watch Days 2025, Zenith’s collaboration with Swiss furniture-maker USM would qualify as a textbook example : a full set of bold, block-colour dials in otherwise traditional stainless steel sports watches.\n\nEarlier this year, Oris’s Big Crown Pointer Date hit a similar note. In 2023, arch-rival Omega debuted a collection of Seamaster Aqua Terra models with similar hues to Rolex's opening salvo; other mid-level brands including Breitling and TAG Heuer have all created multi-colored families of stainless steel, time-only round watches in a similar mold .\n\nThree years after Rolex, Omega followed suit.\n\nMicrobrands are in on the act, too: Split watches immediately sold out of its just-launched, searingly all-yellow Sub 7 . Other brands have incorporated the idea into their own design language. Hublot gave us collections of block-color ceramic watches, taking the impact of a bright dial and flowing it into cases and bracelets alike. You’ll find the same principle at niche watchmakers like Meistersinger and start-ups like Norqain: it’s subtle, and doubtless many would deny the connection, but it’s undeniably a phenomenon that has exploded since 2020.\n\nIn fact, the trend has been so successful Rolex even returned to it this year, launching new versions of the Oyster Perpetual in lilac, beige and pistachio green.\n\n“For years, Rolex communication was very stern, very institutional,” says Fabio Ciquera, an industry consultant who also teaches an MA course in luxury brand management at Ravensbourne University. “Its sponsorship reminded us of the establishment and elite. These new designs play a strategic role—as much as a collab between Louis Vuitton and Murakami—to inject newness into the brand. These may play an ‘anchor’ role in the mind of a new breed of clients who also value the unexpected more than the institutional.”\n\nThen TAG Heuer joined the fray.\n\nIndeed, Rolex’s dial designs have been more unexpected since the introduction of the 2020 collection, with rapidly discontinued (if not overtly limited) editions such as the Datejust with palm dial (made using eye-surgery lasers , no less), and the surprising, controversial “emoji” Day-Date from 2023. Then there was the Celebration, or “bubbles” Oyster Perpetual , a model that took all five colors from the origianl 2020 set and brought them together in one design—also now discontinued.\n\nCiquera explains that despite its market dominance, there is a chance Rolex might be feeling pressure to change its brand image. “[Its younger customers] will feel reassured that their brand of choice is also fun and unexpected, not just Wimbledon and elite,” he says. “At the higher end of the spectrum, we could say that Rolex may have felt the pressure of fun design at brands like Richard Mille , or interesting collabs between Casablanca & MAD Paris [who created a bold, multicolored Audemars Piguet Royal Oak ] and felt like a new take on ‘fun’ would have benefit also. Especially considering the need of a renewed anchor to entice younger clients.”\n\nNow Zenith is launching a brightly hued collection with colors designed to pop.\n\nThe shift from incrementally building out a color range to introducing an entire palette in one drop brings additional design considerations. Each color must not only work in its own right, but in conjunction with the others—and the “bubbles” reference shows how carefully Rolex constructed the palette to begin with. As Professor Renzo Shamey, director of Color Science and Imaging Laboratories at the Wilson College of Textiles of North Carolina State University explains, different pigments and shades “flare” more than others (which may partly explain why the 2020 collection felt so impactful) and their harmonious interaction is dependent on factors such as relative size as well as theories of complementary colors.\n\nOris's latest Big Crown takes its cues from the 2020 Rolex collection as well.\n\n“Color is influenced by the surrounding background and lighting and all sorts of things,” says Shamey. “Even when you control all of these variables, it is highly subjective because our perception of color is a very personal experience. From the point of production, the question is: How do we minimize issues associated with perceived color? If you can generate it in an isolated environment, that's all good and great, but the color is going to sit in a context. So how is that going to match in that environment correctly?”\n\nShamey says that a brand can come up with a color that matches another one perfectly in one scenario, then change the setting and it doesn't match at all. “We call that metabolism,” he says. \"A single color can flare or not match from one setting to the other, while some colors are more color constant than others. Some purples or olives, or some mixed like khakis—if you change the illumination, they can shift quite a bit, while others are less susceptible.”\n\nMicrobrands such as Split are taking the vivid color styling idea beyond just the dial.\n\nAcross the watch industry, brands have reached for this type of pastel shade recently, with pale purples, pistachio green and sandy beige popular beyond Rolex’s 2025 Oyster Perpetuals. Whether the shift from more constant, solid, emphatic colors to those more likely to shift or metamorphose says anything about buying habits in the watch industry is for now a matter of speculation, but dials that appear to change hue under different lighting have long been popular with collectors.\n\nHowever, those hoping for an updated reissue of Rolex's Celebration dial my well be disappointed. The challenge of combining such pastels could mean the brand will think twice about repeating the bubbles trick with its current generation of shades.",

    "title":"The US is trying to kick-start a “nuclear energy renaissance”",
    "body":"Push to revive nuclear energy relies on deregulation; experts say strategy is misplaced.\n\nI n May, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders to facilitate the construction of nuclear reactors and the development of nuclear energy technology; the orders aim to cut red tape, ease approval processes, and reshape the role of the main regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC. These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.”\n\nSelf-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through nuclear fission , in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases.\n\nThe Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050. To help achieve that goal, scientific institutions like the Idaho National Laboratory, a leading research institute in nuclear energy, are pushing forward innovations such as more efficient types of fuel. Companies are also investing millions of dollars to develop their own nuclear reactor designs, a move from industry that was previously unheard of in the nuclear sector. For example, Westinghouse, a Pennsylvania-based nuclear power company, plans to build 10 new large reactors to help achieve the 2050 goal.\n\nHowever, the road to renaissance is filled with familiar obstacles. Nuclear energy infrastructure is “too expensive to build, and it takes too long to build,” said Allison Macfarlane, a science and technology policy expert at the University of British Columbia who used to chair the NRC from 2012 to 2014.\n\nAnd experts are divided on whether new nuclear technologies, such as small versions of reactors, are ready for primetime. The nuclear energy field is now “in a hype bubble that is driving unrealistic expectations,” said Edwin Lyman, the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization that has long acted as a nuclear safety watchdog .\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to advance nuclear energy by weakening the NRC , Lyman said. “The message is that it's regulation that has been the obstacle to deploying nuclear power, and if we just get rid of all this red tape, then the industry is going to thrive,” he added. “I think that's really misplaced.”\n\nAlthough streamlining the approval process might accelerate development, the true problem lies in the high costs of nuclear, which would need to be significantly cheaper to compete with other sources of energy such as natural gas, said Koroush Shirvan, a nuclear science researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Even the license-ready reactors are still not economical,” he said. If the newer reactor technologies do pan out, without government support and subsidies, Shirvan said, it is difficult to imagine them “coming online before 2035.”\n\nR umblings of a nuclear renaissance give experts a sense of déjà vu. The first resurgence in interest was around 2005, when many thought that nuclear energy could mitigate climate change and be an energy alternative to dwindling supply and rising prices of fossil fuels. But that enthusiasm slowed mainly after the Fukushima accident in 2011, in which a tsunami-triggered power outage—along with multiple safety failures—led to a nuclear meltdown at a facility in Japan. “So, the first nuclear renaissance fizzled out,” said Lyman.\n\nGlobally, the proportion of electricity provided by nuclear energy has been dwindling. Although there has been an increase in generation, nuclear energy has contributed less to the share of global electricity demand, dropping to 9 percent in 2024 from a peak of about 17 percent in 2001. In the US, 94 reactors generate about a fifth of the nation’s electricity, a proportion that has held steady since 1990s. But only two of those reactors have come online in the last nearly 30 years.\n\nThis renewed push is “a second bite at the apple, and we’ll have to see but it does seem to have a lot more of a headwind now,” said Lyman.\n\nMuch of that movement comes from the private sector, said Todd Allen, a nuclear engineer at the University of Michigan. In the last couple of decades, dozens of nuclear energy companies have emerged, including TerraPower, co-founded by Bill Gates. “It feels more like normal capitalism than we ever had in nuclear,” Allen said. Those companies are working on developing the large reactors that have been the backbone of nuclear energy for decades, as well as newer technologies that can bolster the field.\n\nProponents say small modular reactors , or SMRs, and microreactors, which generate less than 300 megawatts and 20 megawatts, respectively, could offer safer, cheaper, and more flexible energy compared to their more traditional counterparts. (Large reactors have, on average, 900 megawatts of capacity.) One 2022 study found that modularization can reduce construction time by up to 60 percent.\n\nThese designs have taken the spotlight: In 2024, a report estimated that the SMR market would reach $295 billion by 2043. In June, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Congress that DOE will have at least three SMRs running by July of next year. And in July of this year, the Nuclear Energy Agency launched a dashboard to track SMR technologies around the world, which identified 74 SMR designs at different stages around the world. The first commercial SMR in North America is currently being constructed in Canada, with plans to be operational by 2030.\n\nBut whether SMRs and microreactors are actually safer and more cost-effective remains to be determined. A 2022 study found that SMRs would likely produce more leakage and nuclear waste than conventional reactors. Studying them, though, is difficult since so few are currently operational.\n\nIn part, that may be because of cost. Multiple analyses have concluded that, because of rising construction and operating costs, SMRs might not be financially viable enough to compete for the world’s energy markets, including in developing countries that lack affordable access to electricity.\n\nAnd recent ventures have hit road bumps: For example, NuScale, the only SMR developer with a design approved by the NRC, had to shut down its operations in November 2023 due to increasingly high costs (though another uprated SMR design was approved earlier this year).\n\n“Nothing is really commercialized yet,” said Macfarlane. Most of the tech companies haven’t figured out expenses, supply chains, the kind of waste they are going to produce or security at their reactors, she added.\n\nFuel supply is also a barrier since most plants use uranium enriched at low rates, but SMRs and microreactors use uranium enriched at higher levels, which is typically sourced from Russia and not commercially available in the US. So scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory are working to recover enriched uranium from existing reactors and developed new, more cost-effective fuels, said Jess Gehin, the associate laboratory director for the Nuclear Science & Technology Directorate at the INL. They are also using artificial intelligence and modeling simulation tools and capabilities to optimize nuclear energy systems, he added: “We got to reach 400 gigawatts, we need to accelerate all of this.”\n\nCompanies are determined to face and surpass these barriers. Some have begun pouring concrete, such as one nuclear company called Kairos Power that began building a demo of their SMR design in Tennessee; the plant is projected to be fully operational by 2027. “I would make the case that we're moving faster than many in the field, if not the fastest,” Mike Laufer, the company’s CEO and co-founder, told Reuters last year.\n\nSome experts think achieving nuclear expansion can be done—and revel in the progress so far: “I would have never thought we'd be in this position where we're working so hard to expand nuclear, because for most of my career, it wasn't that way,” said Gehin. “And I would say each month that goes by exceeds my expectations on the next bigger things that are coming.\"\n\nA lthough the Trump administration aims to accelerate nuclear energy through executive orders, in practice, it has not allocated new funding yet, said Matt Bowen, an expert on nuclear energy, waste, and nonproliferation at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. In fact, the initial White House budget proposed cutting $4.7 billion from the Department of Energy, including $408 million from the Office of Nuclear Energy allocated for nuclear research in the 2026 fiscal year.\n\n“The administration was proposing cuts to Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE more broadly, and DOGE is pushing staff out,” said Bowen. “How do you do more with less? Less staff, less money.”\n\nThe Trump administration places the blame for the nuclear sector’s stagnation on the NRC, which oversees licensing and recertification processes that cost the industry millions of dollars each year in compliance. In his executive orders, Trump called for a major reorganization of the NRC. Some of the proposed changes, like streamlining the approval process (which can take years for new plants), may be welcomed because “for a long time, they were very, very, very slow,” said Charles Forsberg, a nuclear chemical engineer at MIT. But there are worries that the executive orders could do more than cut red tape.\n\n“Every word in those orders is of concern, because the thrust of those orders is to essentially strip the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of its independence from the executive branch, essentially nullifying the original purpose,” said Lyman.\n\nSome experts fear that with these new constraints, NRC staff will have less time and fewer resources to do their jobs, which could impact power plant safety in the future. Bowen said: “This notion that the problem for nuclear energy is regulation, and so all we need to do is deregulate, is both wrong and also really problematic.”\n\nThe next few decades will tell whether nuclear, especially SMRs, can overcome economic and technical challenges to safely contribute to decarbonization efforts. Some, like Gehin, are optimistic. “I think we're going to accelerate,” he said. “We certainly can achieve a dramatic deployment if we put our mindset to it.”\n\nBut making nuclear financially competitive will take serious commitment from the government and the dozens of companies, with many still skeptical, Shirvan said. “I am quite, I would say, on the pessimistic scale when it comes to the future of nuclear energy in the US.”\n\nThis article was originally published on Undark .

    "body":"\"It's that level of risk that they were taking. I think that's what really hit home.\"\n\nSix decades have now passed since some of the most iconic Project Gemini spaceflights. The 60th anniversary of Gemini 4, when Ed White conducted the first US spacewalk, came in June. The next mission, Gemini 5, ended just two weeks ago, in 1965. These missions are now forgotten by most Americans, as most of the people alive during that time are now deceased.\n\nHowever, during these early years of spaceflight, NASA engineers and astronauts cut their teeth on a variety of spaceflight firsts, flying a series of harrowing missions during which it seems a miracle that no one died.\n\nBecause the Gemini missions, as well as NASA's first human spaceflight program Mercury, yielded such amazing stories, I was thrilled to realize that a new book has recently been published— Gemini & Mercury Remastered —that brings them back to life in vivid color.\n\nThe book is a collection of 300 photographs from NASA's Mercury and Gemini programs during the 1960s, in which Andy Saunders has meticulously restored the images and then deeply researched their background to more fully tell the stories behind them. The end result is a beautiful and powerful reminder of just how brave America's first pioneers in space were. What follows is a lightly edited conversation with Saunders about how he developed the book and some of his favorite stories from it.\n\nArs : Why put out a book on Mercury and Gemini now?\n\nAndy Saunders : Well, it's the 60th anniversaries of the Gemini missions, but the book is really the prequel to my first book, Apollo Remastered . This is about the missions that came before. So it takes us right back to the very dawn of human space exploration, back to the very beginning, and this was always a project I was going to work on next. Because, as well as being obviously very important in spaceflight history, they're very important in terms of human history, the human evolution, even, you know, the first time we were able to escape Earth.\n\nFor tens of thousands of years, civilizations have looked up and dreamt of leaving Earth and voyaging to the stars. And this golden era in the early 1960s is when that ancient dream finally became a reality. Also, of course, the first opportunity to look back at Earth and give us that unique perspective. But I think it's really the photographs specifically that will just forever symbolize and document at the beginning of our expansion out into the cosmos. You know, of course, we went to the Moon with Apollo. We'll go back with Artemis. We spent long periods on the International Space Station. We'll walk on Mars. We'll eventually become a multi-planetary species. But this is where it all began and how it all began.\n\nArs : They used modified Hasselblad cameras during Apollo to capture these amazing images. What types of cameras were used during Mercury and Gemini?\n\nSaunders : Mercury was more basic cameras. So on the very first missions, NASA didn't want the astronaut to take a camera on board. The capsules were tiny. They were very busy. They're very short missions, obviously very groundbreaking missions. So, the first couple of missions, there was a camera out of the porthole window, just taking photographs automatically. But it was John Glenn on his mission ( Mercury-Atlas 6 ) who said, \"No, I want to take a camera. People want to know what it's going to be like to be an astronaut. They're going to want to look at Earth through the window. I'm seeing things no humans ever seen before.\" So he literally saw a $40 camera in a drugstore on his way after a haircut at Cocoa Beach. He thought, \"That's perfect.\" And he bought it himself, and then NASA adapted it. They put a pistol grip on to help him to use it. And with it, he took the first still photographs of Earth from space.\n\nSo it was the early astronauts that kind of drove the desire to take cameras themselves, but they were quite basic. Wally Schirra ( Mercury-Atlas 8 ) then took the first Hasselblad. He wanted medium format, better quality, but really, the photographs from Mercury aren't as stunning as Gemini. It's partly the windows and the way they took the photos, and they'd had little experience. Also, preservation clearly wasn't high up on the agenda in Mercury, because the original film is evidently in a pretty bad state. The first American in space is an incredibly important moment in history. But every single frame of the original film of Alan Shepard's flight was scribbled over with felt pen, it's torn, and it's fixed with like a piece of sticky tape. But it's a reminder that these weren't taken for their aesthetic quality. They weren't taken for posterity. You know, they were technical information. The US was trying to catch up with the Soviets. Preservation wasn't high up on the agenda.\n\nArs : I want to understand your process. How many photos did you consider for this book?\n\nSaunders : With Apollo, they took about 35,000 photographs. With Mercury and Gemini, there were about 5,000. Which I was quite relieved about.  So yeah, I went through all 5,000 they took. I'm not sure how much 16 millimeter film in terms of time, because it was at various frame rates, but a lot of 16 millimeter film. So I went through every frame of film that was captured from launch to splashdown on every mission.\n\nArs : Out of that material, how much did you end up processing?\n\nSaunders : What I would first do is have a quick look, particularly if there's apparently nothing in them, because a lot of them are very underexposed. But with digital processing, like I did with the cover of the Apollo book, we can pull out stuff that you actually can't see in the raw file. So it's always worth taking a look. So do a very quick edit, and then if it's not of interest, it's discarded. Or it might be that clearly an important moment was happening, even if it's not a particularly stunning photograph, I would save that one. So I was probably down from 5,000 to maybe 800, and then do a better edit on it.\n\nAnd then the final 300 that are in the book are those that are either aesthetically stunning, or they're a big transformation, or they show something important that happened on the mission, or a historically significant moment. But also, what I want to do with the book, as well as showing the photographs, is tell the stories, these incredible human stories that, because of the risks they were taking. So to do that, I effectively reconstructed every mission from launch to splashdown by using lots of different pieces of information in order to effectively map the photography onto a timeline so that it can then tell the story through the captions. So a photograph might be in there simply to help tell part of the story.\n\nArs : What was your favorite story to tell?\n\nSaunders : Well, perhaps in terms of a chapter and a mission, I'd say Gemini 4 is kind of the heart of the book. You know, first US space walk, quite a lot of drama occurred when they couldn't close the hatch. There's some quite poignant shots, particularly of Ed White, of course, who later lost his life in the Apollo 1 fire. But in terms of the story, I mean, Gemini 9A was just, there needs to be a movie about just Gemini 9A. Right from the start, from losing the prime crew, and then just what happened out on Gene Cernan's EVA, how he got back into the capsule alive is quite incredible, and all this detail I've tried to cover because he took his camera. So he called it the spacewalk from hell. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. He was incredibly exhausted, overheated. His visor steamed over. He went effectively blind, and he was at the back of the adapter section. This is at a point when NASA just hadn't mastered EVA. So, simply how you maneuver in space, they just haven't mastered, so he was exhausted. He was almost blind. Then he lost communication with Tom Stafford, his command pilot. He tore his suit, because, of course, back then, there were all kinds of jagged parts on the spacecraft.\n\nAnd then when he's finally back in the hatch, he was quite a big chap, and they couldn't close the hatch, so he was bent double trying to close the hatch. He started to see stars. He said, Tom, if we don't close this hatch now and re-pressurize, I am going to die. They got it closed, got his helmet off, and Tom Stafford said he just looked like someone that had spent far too long in a sauna. Stafford sprayed him with a water hose to kind of cool him down. So what happened on that mission is just quite incredible. But there was something on every mission, you know, from Gus Grissom sinking of the Liberty Bell and him almost drowning, the heat shield coming loose, or an indicator that suggested the heat shield was loose on Glenn's mission. There's an image of that in the book. Like I said, I mapped everything to the timeline, and worked out the frame rates, and we've got the clock we can see over his shoulder. So I could work out exactly when he was at the point of maximum heating through reentry, when part of the strapping that kept the retro pack on, to try and hold a heat shield on that hit the window, and he's talking, but no one was listening, because it was during radio blackout.\n\nThe process I used for this, on the low-quality 16 mm film, was to stack hundreds and hundreds of frames to bring out incredible detail. You can almost see the pores in his skin. To see this level of detail, to me, it's just like a portrait of courage. There he is, holding steadfast, not knowing if he's about to burn up in the atmosphere. So that was quite a haunting image, if you like, to be able to help you step on board, you know, these tiny Mercury spacecraft, to see them, to see what they saw, to look out the windows and see how they saw it.\n\nArs : What was new or surprising to you as you spent so much time with these photos and looking at the details?\n\nSaunders : The human side to them. Now that we can see them this clearly, they seem to have an emotional depth to them. And it's that level of risk that they were taking. I think that's what really hit home. The Earth shots are stunning. You know, you can almost feel the scale, particularly with a super wide lens, and the altitudes they flew to. And you can just imagine what it must have been like out on an EVA, for example. I think Gene Cernan said it was like sitting on God's front porch, the view he had on his EVA. So those Earth shots are stunning, but it's really those the human side that really hits home for me. I read every word of every transcript of every mission. All the conversations were recorded on tape between the air and the ground, and between the astronauts when they were out of ground contact, and reading those it really hits home what they were doing. I found myself holding my breath, and, you know, my shoulders were stiff.\n\nArs : So what's next? I mean, there's only about 100 million photos from the Space Shuttle era.\n\nSaunders : Thankfully, they weren't all taken on film. So if I wanted to complete space on film, then what I haven't yet done is Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab, and the first, whatever it is, 20 percent of the shuttle. So maybe that's next. But I would just like a rest, because I've been doing this now since the middle of 2019, literally nonstop. It's all I've done with Apollo and now Mercury and Gemini. The books make a really nice set in that they're exactly the same size. So it covers the first view of the curvature of Earth and space right through to our last steps on the Moon.",

    "body":"\"When you turn off those spacecraft’s radio receivers, there's no way to turn them back on.\"\n\nFederal funding is about to run out for 19 active space missions studying Earth's climate, exploring the Solar System, and probing mysteries of the Universe.\n\nThis year's budget expires at the end of this month, and Congress must act before October 1 to avert a government shutdown. If Congress passes a budget before then, it will most likely be in the form of a continuing resolution, an extension of this year's funding levels into the first few weeks or months of fiscal year 2026.\n\nThe White House's budget request for fiscal year 2026 calls for a 25 percent cut to NASA's overall budget, and a nearly 50 percent reduction in funding for the agency's Science Mission Directorate. These cuts would cut off money for at least 41 missions, including 19 already in space and many more far along in development.\n\nNormally, a president's budget request isn't the final say on matters. Lawmakers in the House and Senate have written their own budget bills in the last several months. There are differences between each appropriations bill, but they broadly reject most of the Trump administration's proposed cuts.\n\nStill, this hasn't quelled the anxieties of anyone with a professional or layman's interest in space science. The 19 active robotic missions chosen for cancellation are operating beyond their original design lifetime. However, in many cases, they are in pursuit of scientific data that no other mission has a chance of collecting for decades or longer.\n\nSome of the mission names are recognizable to anyone with a passing interest in NASA's work. They include the agency's two Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions monitoring data signatures related to climate change, the Chandra X-ray Observatory , which survived a budget scare last year, and two of NASA's three active satellites orbiting Mars.\n\nAnd there's New Horizons, a spacecraft that made front-page headlines in 2015 when it beamed home the first up-close pictures of Pluto. Another mission on the chopping block is Juno, the world's only spacecraft currently at Jupiter.\n\nBoth spacecraft have more to offer, according to the scientists leading the missions.\n\n“New Horizons is perfectly healthy,\" said Alan Stern, the mission's principal investigator at Southwest Research Institute (SWRI). \"Everything on the spacecraft is working. All the spacecraft subsystems are performing perfectly, as close to perfectly as one could ever hope. And all the instruments are, too. The spacecraft has the fuel and power to run into the late 2040s or maybe 2050.\"\n\nNew Horizons is a decade and more than 2.5 billion miles (4.1 billion kilometers) beyond Pluto. The probe flew by a frozen object named Arrokoth on New Year's Day 2019, returning images of the most distant world ever explored by a spacecraft. Since then, the mission has continued its speedy departure from the Solar System and could become the third spacecraft to return data from interstellar space.\n\nNew Horizons cost taxpayers $780 million from the start of development through the end of its primary mission after exploring Pluto. The project received $9.7 million from NASA to cover operations costs in 2024, the most recent year with full budget data.\n\nIt's unlikely New Horizons will be able to make another close flyby of an object like it did with Pluto and Arrokoth. But the science results keep rolling in. Just last year, scientists announced the news that New Horizons found the Kuiper Belt—a vast outer zone of hundreds of thousands of small, icy worlds beyond the orbit of Neptune—might extend much farther out than previously thought.\n\n\"We're waiting for government, in the form of Congress, the administration, to come up with a funding bill for FY26, which will tell us if our mission is on the chopping block or not,\" Stern said. \"The administration's proposal is to cancel essentially every extended mission ... So, we're not being singled out, but we would get caught in that.\"\n\nStern, who served as head of NASA's science division in 2007 and 2008, said the surest way to prevent the White House's cuts is for Congress to pass a budget with specific instructions for the Trump administration.\n\n\"The administration ultimately will make some decision based on what Congress does,\" Stern said. \"If Congress passes a continuing resolution, then that opens a whole lot of other possibilities where the administration could do something without express direction from Congress. We're just going to have to see where we end up at the end of September and then in the fall.\"\n\nStern said shutting down so many of NASA's science missions would be a \"tragic capitulation of US leadership\" and \"fiscally irresponsible.\"\n\n\"We’re pretty undeniably the frontrunner, and have been for decades, in space sciences,\" Stern said. \"There's much more money in overruns than there is in what it costs to run these missions—I mean, dramatically. And yet, by cutting overruns, you don't affect our leadership position. Turning off spacecraft would put us in third or fourth place, depending on who you talk to, behind the Chinese and the Europeans at least, and maybe behind others.\"\n\nStern resigned his job as NASA's science chief in 2008 after taking a similar stance arguing against cuts to healthy projects and research grants to cover overruns in other programs, according to a report in Science Magazine.\n\nJuno, meanwhile, has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, collecting information on the giant planet's internal structure, magnetic field, and atmosphere.\n\n“Everything is functional,\" said Scott Bolton, the lead scientist on Juno, also from SWRI. \"There's been some degradation, things that we saw many years ago, but those haven't changed. Actually, some of them improved, to be honest.\"\n\nThe only caveat with Juno is some radiation damage to its camera, called JunoCam. Juno orbits Jupiter once every 33 days, and the trajectory brings the spacecraft through intense radiation belts trapped by the planet's powerful magnetic field. Juno's primary mission ended in 2021, and it's now operating in an extended mission approved through the end of this month. The additional time exposed to harsh radiation is, not surprisingly, corrupting JunoCam's images.\n\nIn an interview with Ars, Bolton suggested the radiation issue creates another opportunity for NASA to learn from the Juno mission. Ground teams are attempting to repair the JunoCam imager through annealing, a self-healing process that involves heating the instrument's electronics and then allowing them to cool. Engineers sparingly tried annealing hardware space, so Juno's experience could be instructive for future missions.\n\n\"Even satellites at Earth experience this [radiation damage], but there's very little done or known about it,\" Bolton said. \"In fact, what we're learning with Juno has benefits for Earth satellites, both commercial and national security.\"\n\nJuno's passages through Jupiter's harsh radiation belts provide a real-world laboratory to experiment with annealing in space. \"We can't really produce the natural radiation environment at Earth or Jupiter in a lab,\" Bolton said.\n\nLessons learned from Juno could soon be applied to NASA's next probe traveling to Jupiter. Europa Clipper launched last year and is on course to enter orbit around Jupiter in 2030, when it will begin regular low-altitude flybys of the planet's icy moon Europa. Before Clipper's launch, engineers discovered a flaw that could make the spacecraft's transistors more susceptible to radiation damage. NASA managers decided to proceed with the mission because they determined the damage could be repaired at Jupiter with annealing.\n\n\"So, we have rationale to hopefully continue Juno because of science, national security, and it sort of fits in the goals of exploration as well, because you have high radiation even in these translunar orbits [heading to the Moon],\" Bolton said. \"Learning about how to deal with that and how to build spacecraft better to survive that, and how to repair them, is really an interesting twist that we came by on accident, but nevertheless, turns out to be really important.\"\n\nIt cost $28.4 million to operate Juno in 2024, compared to NASA's $1.13 billion investment to build, launch, and fly the spacecraft to Jupiter.\n\n“We're hoping everything's going to keep going,\" Bolton said. \"We put in a proposal for three years. The science is potentially very good. ... But it’s sort of unknown. We just are waiting to hear and waiting for direction from NASA, and we're watching all of the budget scenarios, just like everybody else, in the news.\"\n\nNASA headquarters earlier this year asked Stern and Bolton, along with teams leading other science missions coming under the ax, for an outline of what it would take and what it would cost to \"close out\" their projects. \"We sent something that was that was a sketch of what it might look like,\" Bolton said.\n\nA \"closeout\" would be irreversible for at least some of the 19 missions at risk of termination.\n\n\"Termination doesn't just mean shutting down the contract and sending everybody away, but it's also turning the spacecraft off,\" Stern said. \"And when you turn off those spacecraft’s radio receivers, there's no way to turn them back on because they're off. They can never get a command in.\n\n\"So, if we change our mind, we've had another election, or had some congressional action, anything like that, it’s really terminating the spacecraft, and there’s no going back.\"",

    "body":"A battle is brewing over mRNA vaccines, which could intensify backlash against Kennedy.\n\nUnder ardent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr, federal health officials are working to link COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to the deaths of 25 children, and may further restrict access to the shots, possibly recommending them for people aged 75 and up, instead of 65 and up, according to The Washington Post .\n\nFour unnamed sources close to the situation told the Post that Trump administration health officials appear to be using information from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to make the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have killed children. VAERS is a system in which anyone can report anything they think is an adverse event related to a vaccination. The reports are completely unverified upon submission, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff follow up on serious reports to try to substantiate claims and assess if they were actually caused by a vaccine. They rarely are.\n\nFederal health experts continuously monitor VAERS and other safety surveillance systems, exhaustively assessing the safety of vaccines. After billions of COVID-19 doses have been administered worldwide, they—like other governments, health organizations, and academic researchers around the world—have found the shots to be remarkably safe. While they have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis (inflammation of the heart and surrounding tissue, respectively), that risk is low and the cases are generally mild. During the 2023–2024 COVID-19 season, the incidence rate of heart conditions was 27 cases per million doses for males aged 12 to 24, who have the highest risk of any group. The shots have not been linked to deaths or heart transplants, according to data presented by staff experts at the CDC .\n\nGenerally, among people of all ages, death rates were lower for those vaccinated with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines than in the general population. Meanwhile, 25 children died of COVID-19 —the disease, not the vaccine—since July 2023. Of those 25 children, 16 were old enough to get vaccinated, but 14 had no record of getting a vaccine, and none were up-to-date on their vaccines.\n\nStill, Kennedy has a long-established disdain for the mRNA vaccines. In 2021, at the height of the pandemic, Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to revoke authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future COVID-19 vaccines. He has since repeatedly spread false information about the vaccine, including claiming, without evidence, that they have caused the death of children and are \" the deadliest vaccine[s] ever made .\" In making those comments, Kennedy has pointed to VAERS as his data source.\n\nNow that Kennedy is Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), he has continued his anti-vaccine agenda and diligently installed allies in federal health agencies who share his anti-vaccine, anti-science, and anti-public health views.\n\nFor instance, last month, Kennedy canceled nearly $500 million in grants that supported developing mRNA vaccines to prevent the next pandemic. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 highly qualified and respected experts on a vaccine advisory panel for the CDC—the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—which sets the vaccine standards and insurance coverage for the country. Kennedy quickly restocked ACIP with hand-selected members who share his contempt for mRNA vaccines and pandemic policies. He's currently considering adding more such members.\n\nKennedy's ACIP is scheduled to meet next week, September 18 and 19 , to discuss COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the Hepatitis B vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (MMRV) vaccine, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).\n\nWhile the new members could vote to further restrict access to any of those safe, lifesaving vaccines , most of the focus has been on COVID-19 vaccine access. That access is currently in chaos due to new restrictions and a lack of updated ACIP recommendations, which are usually made earlier in the year. Under Kennedy, the FDA restricted access to the vaccines, changing the product approvals from being available to everyone ages 6 months and up to now only being approved for those 65 and older, and those under 64 who have a medical condition that puts them at a higher risk of COVID-19.\n\nWhile some experts and health care providers had hoped that next week's ACIP meeting would add clarity to the situation and allow healthy adults and children better access to the shots, the Post's reporting suggests that's unlikely. According to their sources, Kennedy's ACIP is considering recommending the vaccines to those 75 and older, while instructing those 74 and younger to speak with their doctor about getting a shot. Another reported option is to not recommend the vaccine to people under the age of 75 at all, unless they have a preexisting condition.\n\nSuch additional restrictions would likely intensify the backlash against Kennedy's anti-vaccine agenda. Already, medical organizations have taken the unprecedented action to release their own evidence-based guidances that maintain COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children, particularly those under age 2, pregnant people, and healthy adults . Many medical and health organizations , as well as lawmakers, and over 1,000 current and former HHS employees have also called for Kennedy to resign.\n\nCriticism of Kennedy's actions has spread across party lines. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a vaccine-supporting physician who cast a critical vote for Kennedy's confirmation, had accused Kennedy of denying people vaccines and called for next week's ACIP meeting to be postponed.\n\n“Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting,\" Cassidy said . \"These decisions directly impact children’s health, and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted. If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a clear rebuff of Kennedy's cancellation of mRNA vaccine funding, the Republican-led House Committee on Appropriations this week passed a 2026 spending bill that was specifically amended to inject the words \" including of mRNA vaccines \" into a sentence about pandemic preparedness funding. The bill now reads: \"$1,100,000,000, to remain available through September 30, 2027, shall be for expenses necessary to support advanced research and development, including of mRNA vaccines, pursuant to section 319L of the PHS Act and other administrative expenses of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.\"",

    "body":"Unofficial mod lets classic Nintendo GameCube title use AI chatbots with amusing results.\n\nWhen software engineer Joshua Fonseca recently connected the GameCube simulation classic Animal Crossing to a modern AI language model like the kind that powers ChatGPT, he decided to shake things up. By programming the AI to roleplay as villagers growing aware of their debt situation, and giving them a shared memory to track conversations, Fonseca orchestrated a scenario where the residents began to organize against their raccoon landlord.\n\nIn Animal Crossing , Tom Nook runs the town shop and provides home loans (paid out in bells, the in-game currency) that keep players perpetually in debt, which is a core mechanic of the game.\n\n\"Predictably, it escalated into an anti-Tom Nook movement,\" Fonseca wrote in a detailed post documenting his hack that bridges a 2002 game to cloud-based AI without modifying any game code. While Fonseca frames the uprising as a type of emergent phenomenon in his post and a YouTube video, examination of the source code by AI researcher Simon Willison shows that Fonseca specifically instructed the villagers to behave this way and even escalate the unrest over time.\n\n\"You are a resident of a town run by Tom Nook. You are beginning to realize your mortgage is exploitative and the economy is unfair,\" reads the initial prompt. \"Discuss this with the player and other villagers when appropriate.\"\n\nEven though Fonseca stacked the deck, so to speak, it's still an interesting technical hack.\n\nAfter connecting the simulated villagers to a real-world newsfeed to provide context, characters began relating headlines in casual conversation, which the developer found surreal. One villager named Mitzi suddenly announced, \"About the news? European leaders are planning to meet with Trump and Zelenskyy!\" Another delivered a humorous simulation of self-awareness: \"Oh my gosh, Josh! I just had the weirdest dream, like, everything we do is a game! Arfer!\"\n\nAs amusing as this type of mod is, it's worth remembering that large language models are always playing roles prompted by humans, pulling statistically plausible outputs from training data that researchers fed into their neural networks when they created or later fine-tuned them.\n\nMaking this amusing amalgam of past and present technology possible required some clever engineering. The technical feat Fonseca pulled off involves a Python script that monitors the game memory through the Dolphin emulator, sends dialogue context to AI models like GPT-5 or Gemini, and writes the responses back into the GameCube's RAM.\n\nThe GameCube presented unique obstacles for this project. With its 485 MHz PowerPC processor, 24MB of RAM, and no Internet connectivity (unless you add the Modem or Broadband Adapter ), the console was \"fundamentally, physically, and philosophically designed to be an offline island,\" Fonseca notes.\n\nHis timing proved fortunate. The Animal Crossing decompilation community had just finished reverse-engineering the game's source code, providing readable C instead of PowerPC assembly. This gave him access to the dialogue system's inner workings through a file called m_message.c. (He considered using the Broadband Adapter, but it would have added many layers of additional complexity to the project.)\n\nRather than write an entire network stack for the GameCube from scratch, Fonseca implemented what he calls a \"memory mailbox.\" This classic game modding technique uses specific RAM addresses as communication channels. His Python script writes directly to GameCube memory through Dolphin while the game reads from those same locations.\n\nFinding these addresses required what Fonseca describes as becoming a \"memory archaeologist.\" He wrote a custom scanner and spent hours in a loop: talk to a villager, freeze the emulator when dialogue appeared, scan all 24 million bytes of RAM for the text string, then cross-reference with different villagers. He eventually located the speaker's name and dialogue buffer at specific addresses.\n\nBut discovering the addresses was only half the problem. When you talk to a villager in Animal Crossing , the game normally displays dialogue instantly. Calling an AI model over the Internet takes several seconds. Willison examined the code and found Fonseca's solution: a watch_dialogue() function that polls memory 10 times per second. When it detects a conversation starting, it immediately writes placeholder text: three dots with hidden pause commands between them, followed by a \"Press A to continue\" prompt.\n\n\"So the user gets a 'press A to continue' button and hopefully the LLM has finished by the time they press that button,\" Willison noted in a Hacker News comment. While players watch dots appear and reach for the A button, the mod races to get a response from the AI model and translate it into the game's dialog format.\n\nSimply writing text to memory froze the game. Animal Crossing uses an encoded format with control codes that manage everything from text color to character emotions. A special prefix byte (0x7F) signals commands rather than characters. Without the proper end-of-conversation control code, the game waits forever.\n\n\"Think of it like HTML,\" Fonseca explains. \"Your browser doesn't just display words; it interprets tags ... to make text bold.\" The decompilation community had documented these codes, allowing Fonseca to build encoder and decoder tools that translate between a human-readable format and the GameCube's expected byte sequences.\n\nInitially, he tried using a single AI model to handle both creative writing and technical formatting. \"The results were a mess,\" he notes. \"The AI was trying to be a creative writer and a technical programmer simultaneously and was bad at both.\"\n\nThe solution: split the work between two models. A Writer AI creates dialogue using character sheets scraped from the Animal Crossing fan wiki. A Director AI then adds technical elements, including pauses, color changes, character expressions, and sound effects.\n\nThe code is available on GitHub , though Fonseca warns it contains known bugs and has only been tested on macOS. The mod requires Python 3.8+, API keys for either Google Gemini or OpenAI, and Dolphin emulator. Have fun sticking it to the man—or the raccoon, as the case may be.",

    "body":"Meanwhile, Congress is trying to keep serious scientists from weighing in.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has continued to refer to efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change as a scam, it has done almost nothing to counter the copious scientific evidence that demonstrates that climate change is real and doing real damage to the citizens of the US. The lone exception has been a draft Department of Energy report prepared by a handful of carefully chosen fringe figures that questioned the mainstream understanding of climate change. The shoddy work and questionable conclusions of that report were so extensive that an analysis of it required over 450 pages to detail all of its shortcomings.\n\nBut its shortcomings may not have been limited to the science, as a lawsuit alleges that its preparation violated a law that regulates the activities of federal advisory panels. Now, in an attempt to avoid dealing with that lawsuit, the Department of Energy is claiming that it dissolved the committee that prepared the report, making the lawsuit moot.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress is also attempting to muddy the waters. In response to the DOE report, the National Academies of Science announced that it would prepare a report describing the current state of climate science. Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight have responded by announcing an investigation of the National Academies \"for undermining the EPA.\"\n\nAs we noted in our original coverage, the members of the advisory group that prepared the DOE report were carefully chosen for having views that are well outside the mainstream of climate science. Based on their past public statements, they could be counted on to produce a report that would question the severity of climate change and raise doubts about whether we had any evidence it was happening. The report they produced went beyond that by suggesting that the net effect of our carbon emissions was likely to be a positive for humanity.\n\nNot only was that shoddy science, but a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists suggested that it was likely illegal. Groups like the one that wrote the report, the suit alleges, fall under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which (among other things) dictates that these groups must be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented,\" rather than be selected in order to reinforce a single point of view.\n\nThe \"among other things\" that the law dictates is that the advisory groups have public meetings that are announced in advance, be chartered with a well-defined mission, and all of their records be made available to the public. In contrast, nobody within the Department of Energy, including the contrarians who wrote the report, acknowledged the work they were doing publicly until the day the draft report was released.\n\nThe suit alleges that the work of this group fell under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and the group violated the act in all of the above ways and more. The act asks the courts to force the DOE to disclose all the relevant records involved with the preparation of the report, and to cease relying on it for any regulatory actions. That's significant because the Environmental Protection Agency cited it in its attempts to roll back its prior finding that greenhouse gases posed a danger to the US public.\n\nThis week, the DOE responded in court by claiming the panel that produced the report had been dissolved , making the suit moot. That does not address the fact that the EPA is continuing to rely on the report in its attempts to argue there's no point in regulating greenhouse gases. It also leaves the report itself in a weird limbo. Its release marked the start of a period of public comment, and said comments were supposed to be considered during the revisions that would take place before the draft was finalized.\n\nFailure to complete the revision process would leave the EPA vulnerable to claims that it's relying on an incomplete draft report for its scientific justifications. So, while the DOE's tactics may protect some of its internal documents, it may ultimately cause larger problems for the Trump administration's agenda.\n\nEarlier this year, we were critical of the US's National Academies of Science for seemingly refusing to respond to the Trump administration's attacks on science. That reticence appeared to end in August with the release of the DOE climate report and the announcement that the EPA was using that report as the latest word on climate science, which it argued had changed considerably since the initial EPA decisions on this issue in 2009.\n\nIn response, the National Academies announced that it would fast-track a new analysis of the risks posed by greenhouse gases, this one done by mainstream scientists instead of a handful of fringe figures. The goal was to get it done before the EPA closed its public comment period on its proposal to ignore greenhouse gases.\n\nObviously, this poses a threat to the EPA's planned actions, which apparently prompted Republicans in Congress to step in. Earlier this month, the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), announced he was investigating the National Academies for preparing this report, calling it \"a blatant partisan act to undermine the Trump Administration.\"\n\nComer has also sent a letter to the National Academies, outlining his concerns and demanding a variety of documents. Some of these are pretty convoluted: \"The study is led by a National Academies member who serves as an external advisor to the Science Philanthropy Alliance, which has ties to the left-wing group Arabella Advisors through the New Venture Fund, an organization that promotes a variety of progressive causes and funds major climate litigation,\" Comer says, suggesting ... it's not entirely clear what. Another member of the study panel had the audacity to endorse former President Biden for his climate policies. Separately, Comer says he's concerned about the source of the funds that will pay for this study.\n\nSome of Comer's demands are consistent with this, focusing on funding for this review. But he goes well beyond that, demanding a list of all the National Academies' sources of funding, as well as any internal communications about this study. He's also going on a bit of a witch hunt within the federal government, demanding any communications the NAS has had with government employees regarding the DOE's report or the EPA's greenhouse gas decisions.\n\nIt's pretty clear that Comer recognizes that any unbiased presentation of climate science is going to undercut the EPA's rationale for reversing course on greenhouse gas regulations. So, he's preparing in advance to undercut that presentation by claiming it's rife with conflicts of interest—and he's willing to include \"supporting politicians who want to act on climate change\" as a conflict.\n\nAll of this maneuvering is taking place before the EPA has even finalized its planned U-turn on greenhouse gases, a step that will undoubtedly trigger additional investigations and lawsuits. In many ways, this is likely to reflect many of these parties laying the groundwork for the legal fight to come. And, while some of this is ostensibly about the state of the science that has supported the EPA's past policy decisions, it's clear that the administration and its supporters are doing their best to minimize science's impact on their preferred course of action.",

    "title":"After Kirk shooting, Utah governor calls social media a “cancer.” Will we treat it like one?",
    "body":"We did not evolve to handle this, Utah governor says.\n\nThe conservative broadcaster\/provocateur Charlie Kirk—murdered this week during a visit to a Utah college—had tweeted some life advice this summer: \"When things are moving very fast and people are losing their minds, it’s important to stay grounded. Turn off your phone, read scripture, spend time with friends, and remember internet fury is not real life. It’s going to be ok.\"\n\nKirk was not himself always a great role model for staying grounded, thoughtful, or caring to others. He was better known for \"look at me\" stunts like offering completely unsolicited commentary upon Taylor Swift's engagement , calling the singer a \"cat lady\" and telling her to \"engage in reality more,\" to \"reject feminism,\" and to \"submit to your husband\" because \"you're not in charge.\"\n\nBut his advice itself isn't all bad. Social media so often feeds most hungrily upon our darker emotions; constant reinforcement of anger, fear, frustration, and even jealously (FOMO, anyone?) cannot possibly be good for us to marinate in so often. Maintaining a connection to the physical world and the physical presence of others can be immensely stabilizing—sometimes even helpfully \"boring\"—after we become too addicted to the rush of emotions caused by one more Internet outrage.\n\nKirk was wrong about two things in that tweet, though. First, \"Internet fury\" is quite clearly real life. And two, things may not \"be ok\" even after you set down the phone and are sitting beneath a tent in Utah, talking to students.\n\nAuthorities announced today that, after several incorrect detentions, they are reasonably certain they have arrested Kirk's shooter. Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said at a press conference that the shooter's bullets were covered with various bits of graffiti , including:\n\n“Notices bulge OwO what’s this?” ( online meme involving furries) “Hey fascist! Catch!” “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao ciao ciao” “If you read this you are gay LMAO”\n\nThere was also a series of markings described as \"up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrow symbols.\" The New York Times described these as a possible \"reference to a sequence of controller moves that unleashes bombs in the popular video game Helldivers 2 .\"\n\nThis is an extremely online style of writing—cryptic, meme-driven, and jokey even about serious or disturbing issues. Was the alleged shooter helped toward his act of violence by the communities he was in online? And are millions of Internet users helping or hurting their own moral and civic identities by watching detailed video of the murder, which was immediately shared on social media?\n\nAs his press conference wrapped up, Cox made a plea for everyone to follow Kirk's tweeted advice (which he cited). He said that \"we are not wired as human beings—biologically, historically—we have not evolved in a way that we are capable of processing those types of violent imagery... This is not good for us. It is not good to consume.\"\n\nAnd he added that \"social media is a cancer on our society right now. I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in your community.\"\n\nThis could have been useful to Extremely Online People like the alleged shooter, who was turned in by some of his own family members and who might have been dissuaded from his actions had he engaged more directly with them. (Of course, simplistic advice like this is often wrong; difficult family members and broken relationships might mean that in-person connection is also unhelpful for some.)\n\nIt might also be good advice for the kinds of Extremely Online People who lead the country by posting social media threats to unleash the \"Department of War\" upon Chicago, shown burning in the background.\n\nAt its heart, though, Cox raises a question about whether social media is 1) a powerful force capable of both great good and terrible incitement and misinformation, or whether it is 2) a mere cancer.\n\nI assume Ars readers are divided on this question, given that the Ars staff itself has differing views. One can point, of course, to the successes: The powerless can call out the lies of the powerful, they can gin up \"color revolutions\" to topple dictators, and they can publish their views with an ease and at a cost that not even the printing press—itself an extremely disruptive technology—could manage. On the flip side, of course, is all the \"cancer\": the floods of misinformation and bile, the yelling, the \"cancel culture,\" the virtue signaling, the scams and hoaxes, the ethnic nationalism, the casual sharing of both gore and pornography, the buffoonish natures of the tech overlords who run too many of these services, and that feeling you get when you log in to Facebook and realize with a shock that your aunt is a closet racist.\n\nThe question for me—a live question, one I'm not sure I can answer—is whether all these negative effects will eventually be regulated or suppressed once we acquire more familiarity with the technology, or whether the fundamentally addictive design of social media apps will pose an insoluble challenge to human willpower and flourishing. Or maybe we put too much blame on \"addictive tech\" when in reality, humans fundamentally pine for spectacle, outrage, cruelty, and a sense of community formed by excluding others. (Social media, in this view, may be more of a diagnostic tool for our condition than a cause of it.) Or perhaps the answer is \"all of the above.\"\n\nCan we save the virtues and limit the vices of social media by imposing \"screen time limits,\" avoiding the most toxic communities, and blocking the many online charlatans and fools? Are there lessons we can learn from the general success of the Ars comments, which have been, on the whole, a productive (and highly moderated) enterprise among a specific community? Should we seek to return to smaller and more moderated groups rather than the current global free-for-all of social media? Should we demand that social media apps have more moderation and, if so, do we want to keep this moderation \"neutral\" or let it be more explicitly \"political\"? What will we gain by \"raising the gates\" against certain kinds of posts and posters—and what will we lose?\n\nOr is it time, as Cox's metaphor actually suggests, to treat social media as something irredeemable and to reach for the chemotherapy, the radiation, and the surgeon's scalpel?",

    "title":"Electric vehicle sales grew 25% worldwide but just 6% in North America",
    "body":"North America has bought 1.3 million EVs this year; China has bought 7.6 million.\n\nHere's some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total.\n\nHowever, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain.\n\nBut despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.\n\nTesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region's Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July.\n\nChina had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year.\n\nMeanwhile, here in North America, things aren't quite so hot. EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024. August was actually a good month for EV sales in the US as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the IRS 30D tax credit for clean vehicles, which disappears at the end of September.\n\nThat's a result of anti-EV policies put in place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, and it's far from the only one . Other tax credits intended to foster EV adoption by businesses are also being eradicated. The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer fining automakers for failing to meet fleet averages, and the Trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure.\n\n\"Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,\" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. \"The North American market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the US accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of September. Momentum remains in Europe, underpinned by the emissions legislation, with major automotive countries, Germany and the UK, growing by 45 percent and 31 percent [year to date], respectively. [Year on year] growth in the Chinese market slowed in July–August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,\" Lester said.",

    "title":"California bill lets renters escape exclusive deals between ISPs and landlords",
    "body":"Bill author says law \"gives this industry an opportunity to treat people fairly.\"\n\nCalifornia's legislature this week approved a bill to let renters opt out of bulk-billing arrangements that force them to pay for Internet service from a specific provider.\n\nThe bill says that by January 1, a landlord must \"allow the tenant to opt out of paying for any subscription from a third-party Internet service provider, such as through a bulk-billing arrangement, to provide service for wired Internet, cellular, or satellite service that is offered in connection with the tenancy.\" If a landlord fails to do so, the tenant \"may deduct the cost of the subscription to the third-party Internet service provider from the rent,\" and the landlord would be prohibited from retaliating.\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate in a 30–7 vote on Wednesday but needs Gov. Gavin Newsom's signature to become law. It was approved by the state Assembly in a 75–0 vote in April.\n\nAssemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democratic lawmaker who authored the bill, told Ars today that lobby groups for Internet providers and real estate companies have been \"working really hard\" to defeat it. But she expects Newsom will approve.\n\n\"I strongly believe that the governor is going to look at what this bill provides as far as protections for tenants and sign it into law,\" Ransom said in a phone interview.\n\nRansom disputed claims from lobby groups that bulk billing reduces Internet prices for tenants.\n\n\"This is kind of like a first step in trying to give this industry an opportunity to just treat people fairly. It's not super restrictive. We are not banning bulk billing. We're not even limiting how much money the people can make. What we're saying here with this bill is that if a tenant wants to opt out of the arrangement, they should be allowed to opt out,\" she said.\n\nA stricter bill could have told landlords that \"you can't charge the customer more than you're paying. We could have put a cap on the amount that you're able to charge,\" she said. \"There's so many other things that we could have done that would've been a lot less business-friendly. But the goal was not to harm business, the goal was to help people.\"\n\nIn theory, bulk billing could reduce prices for tenants if discounts negotiated between landlords and Internet providers were passed on to renters. But, Ransom said, \"where there would be an opportunity for these huge discounts to be passed on to tenants, it's not happening. We know of thousands of tenants across the state who are in landlord-tenant agreements where the landlord is actually adding an additional bonus for themselves, pocketing change, and not passing the discount on to the tenants... once we started working on this bill, we started to hear more and more about places where people were stuck in these agreements and their landlords were not letting them out.\"\n\nRansom said not all landlords do this and that it is generally \"the large corporate landlords\" who own hundreds or thousands of properties that \"were the ones who were reluctant to let their tenants out.\"\n\nCalifornia's action comes about eight months after the Federal Communications Commission abandoned a proposal to give tenants the right to opt out of bulk billing for Internet service. The potential federal action was proposed in March 2024 by then-FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, but nixed in January 2025 by Chairman Brendan Carr.\n\nBulk billing contracts are only banned by the FCC when they give a provider the exclusive right to access and serve a building. Despite that restriction, a bulk billing deal between an ISP and landlord can make it less financially feasible for other providers to serve a multi-unit building. Letting people opt out of bulk billing arrangements makes serving a building at least slightly more viable for a competing provider.\n\nRansom said the FCC action \"was very unfortunate\" and \"give[s] a disadvantage to people who are already at the mercy of landlords.\"\n\nThe California bill was not welcomed by lobby groups for Internet providers and landlords. The California Broadband & Video Association, which represents cable companies, paid for a sponsored commentary in several news publications to express its opposition.\n\n\"AB 1414 is an anti-affordability bill masked as consumer protection, and it will only serve to widen the digital divide in California,\" wrote the lobby group's CEO, Janus Norman.\n\nNorman complained that property owners would have \"to provide a refund to tenants who decline the Internet service provided through the building's contract with a specific Internet service provider.\" He argued that without bulk billing, \"low-income families and tenants risk losing access altogether.\"\n\nLetting tenants opt out of bulk deals \"undermines the basis of the cost savings and will lead to bulk billing being phased out,\" Norman wrote. This \"will result in higher bills for everyone, including those already struggling,\" he claimed.\n\n\"The truth, very simply, is this: bulk billing is good for consumers,\" the cable industry commentary said. \"Taking away bulk discounts raises total housing costs when Californians can least afford it.\"\n\nThe bill also drew opposition from the Real Estate Technology & Transformation Center (RETTC). The group's sponsors include real estate companies and Internet providers AT&T, Comcast, and Cox. Another notable sponsor of RETTC is RealPage, which has faced claims from the US government and state attorneys general that its software distorts competition in rental housing by helping landlords collectively set prices.\n\n\"AB 1414 introduces an opt-out requirement that would fundamentally undermine the economics of bulk billing,\" the RETTC said . \"By fragmenting service, it could destabilize networks and reduce the benefits residents and operators rely on today.\" The group claimed the bill could lead to \"higher broadband costs for renters, reduced ISP investment in multifamily housing, disruption of property-wide smart technology, [and] widening of the digital divide in California.\"\n\nThe RETTC said it joined with the National Apartment Association and the California Rental Housing Association to detail the groups' concerns directly to the bill sponsors.\n\nThe California Broadband & Video Association seems to be worried about wireless providers serving buildings wired up with cable. The group's commentary claimed that \"the bill's lack of technology neutrality also creates winners and losers, granting certain types of providers an unfair advantage over their competitors.\"\n\nRansom said her bill may be especially helpful for wireless or satellite providers because they wouldn't need to install wires in each building.\n\n\"This does help with market competition, and in fact some of our support came from some of the smaller Internet service providers... and because this bill is technology-neutral, it helps with not only the current technology, but any new technology that comes out,\" she said.\n\nWhile Ransom's bill could help make broadband more affordable for renters, California lawmakers recently abandoned a more aggressive effort to require affordable broadband plans. Assemblymember Tasha Boerner proposed a state law that would force Internet service providers to offer $15 monthly plans to people with low incomes but tabled the bill after the Trump administration threatened to block funding for expanding broadband networks.",

    "body":"Experts find fake sources in Canadian government report that took 18 months to complete.\n\nOn Friday, CBC News reported that a major education reform document prepared for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador contains at least 15 fabricated citations that academics suspect were generated by an AI language model—despite the same report calling for \"ethical\" AI use in schools.\n\n\"A Vision for the Future: Transforming and Modernizing Education,\" released August 28, serves as a 10-year roadmap for modernizing the province's public schools and post-secondary institutions. The 418-page document took 18 months to complete and was unveiled by co-chairs Anne Burke and Karen Goodnough, both professors at Memorial University's Faculty of Education, alongside Education Minister Bernard Davis.\n\nOne of the fake citations references a 2008 National Film Board movie called \"Schoolyard Games\" that does not exist, according to a board spokesperson. The exact citation reportedly appears in a University of Victoria style guide, a document that teaches students how to format references using fictional examples. The style guide warns on its first page that \"Many citations in this guide are fictitious,\" meaning they are made-up examples used only to demonstrate proper formatting. Yet someone (or some AI chatbot) copied the fake example directly into the Education Accord report as if it were a real source.\n\nAaron Tucker, a Memorial assistant professor whose research focuses on AI history in Canada, told CBC he could not find numerous sources cited in the report despite searching the MUN Library, other academic databases, and Google. \"The fabrication of sources at least begs the question: did this come from generative AI?\" Tucker told CBC. \"Whether that's AI, I don't know, but fabricating sources is a telltale sign of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nSince the inception of AI language models, generating fabricated citations has been a continuous problem . The tendency to confabulate academic citations often causes particular trouble in academic and legal contexts, where fabricated sources can easily slip past lazy human review because they appear properly formatted and contextually appropriate.\n\nAI language models like the kind that power ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude excel at producing exactly this kind of believable fiction because they first and foremost produce plausible outputs , not accurate ones. They always generate a statistical approximation based on patterns absorbed during training. When those patterns don't align well with reality, the result is confident-sounding misinformation. Even AI models that can search the web for real sources can potentially fabricate citations, choose the wrong ones, or mischaracterize them.\n\n\"Errors happen. Made-up citations are a totally different thing where you essentially demolish the trustworthiness of the material,\" Josh Lepawsky, the former president of the Memorial University Faculty Association who resigned from the report's advisory board in January, told CBC, citing a \"deeply flawed process.\"\n\nThe presence of potentially AI-generated fake citations becomes especially awkward given that one of the report's 110 recommendations specifically states the provincial government should \"provide learners and educators with essential AI knowledge, including ethics, data privacy, and responsible technology use.\"\n\nSarah Martin, a Memorial political science professor who spent days reviewing the document, discovered multiple fabricated citations. \"Around the references I cannot find, I can't imagine another explanation,\" she told CBC. \"You're like, 'This has to be right, this can't not be.' This is a citation in a very important document for educational policy.\"\n\nWhen contacted by CBC, co-chair Karen Goodnough declined an interview request, writing in an email: \"We are investigating and checking references, so I cannot respond to this at the moment.\"\n\nThe Department of Education and Early Childhood Development acknowledged awareness of \"a small number of potential errors in citations\" in a statement to CBC from spokesperson Lynn Robinson. \"We understand that these issues are being addressed, and that the online report will be updated in the coming days to rectify any errors.\"",

That's finally set to change next February with Nintendo's first-ever official re-release of Virtual Boy games—at least for players who invest $100 in a required Virtual Boy-shaped Switch dock (or a cheaper cardboard holder) to make them work.\n\nVirtual Boy – Nintendo Classics will be available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members on #NintendoSwitch and #NintendoSwitch2 starting Feb 17, 2026! #NintendoDirect pic.twitter.com\/VnCO0DiX3S\n\n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) September 12, 2025\n\nSubscribers to Nintendo Switch Online in the US and Canada will soon be able to purchase that $100 dock , which Nintendo says \"recreates the form of the original Virtual Boy hardware,\" or a slender $25 cardboard alternative . Then, starting on February 17, those players will be able to play downloaded Virtual Boy games (included with an Expansion Pack subscription) by inserting a Switch or Switch 2 into one of those retro replicas. The system will presumably display those games in a split-screen mode that can be viewed through special lenses to replicate the Virtual Boy's original 384×224 resolution, four-shades-of-red stereoscopic display.\n\nNintendo's announcement says you'll \"need this dedicated accessory\" to play Virtual Boy titles through a Switch, suggesting that flat-screen play on a console without one of the custom docks won't be possible. And while \"purchase limits apply\" to the plastic Virtual Boy replica (which seems likely to be a collectible available only in limited supplies), the cheaper cardboard model seems designed for wider availability.\n\nNintendo also says that \"Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2 controllers are required to play,\" suggesting we won't be getting replicas of the Virtual Boy's unique, dual D-pad controller (as we have for other classic Nintendo pads ).\n\nNintendo says 14 Virtual Boy titles will be made available to Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers over time. The eventual software list includes cult-classic Nintendo first-party titles like Virtual Boy Wario Land and Mario's Tennis , as well as extremely hard-to-find third-party games like Jack Bros. and Virtual Bowling , which can command hundreds or thousands of dollars for an original cartridge.\n\nThe fact that Nintendo is officially acknowledging these games at all is a bit surprising after all these years of neglect. Even the 3DS Virtual Console —which would have seemed like a natural place for a Virtual Boy resurgence—never got official support for the retro system. Instead, fans of Nintendo's least successful console (it's estimated to have sold fewer than 800,000 units) have either had to track down rare original hardware and software or resort to unofficial emulators (one of which recently added full-color support beyond the usual red tints displayed by the original console).\n\nThe Switch-docking strategy Nintendo is using for stereoscopy here is more than a bit reminiscent of 2019's Nintendo Labo VR , which slotted the original Switch into a lens-equipped cardboard sleeve for a low-resolution, bare bones introduction to the idea of VR. At the time, we called that experiment a \"fine, serviceable, decent\" introduction to virtual reality seemingly designed for small children.\n\nToday's Virtual Boy announcement, of course, comes with a hefty added dose of nostalgia and represents a long-overdue official recognition of an often-ignored part of Nintendo history. For all its faults, the Virtual Boy was a prime example of Nintendo designer Gunpei Yokoi's philosophy of \"lateral thinking with withered technology,\" as Ars' own Benj Edwards laid out in detail when contributing to a book-length treatise on the console .",

    "title":"New pathway engineered into plants lets them suck up more CO₂",
    "body":"Engineered pathway lets carbon be plugged directly into key metabolic pathways.\n\nLots of people are excited about the idea of using plants to help us draw down some of the excess carbon dioxide we've been pumping into the atmosphere. It would be nice to think that we could reforest our way out of the mess we're creating, but recent studies have indicated there's simply not enough productive land for this to work out.\n\nOne alternative might be to get plants to take up carbon dioxide more efficiently. Unfortunately, the enzyme that incorporates carbon dioxide into photosynthesis, called RUBISCO, is remarkably inefficient . So, a team of researchers in Taiwan decided to try something new—literally. They put together a set of enzymes that added a new-to-nature biochemical cycle to plants that let it incorporate carbon far more efficiently. The resulting plants grew larger and incorporated more carbon.\n\nIn the abstract, incorporating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the biochemistry of the cell seems simple—you just link up a few of the carbon atoms and you're off. But in reality, it's fiendishly complicated. Carbon dioxide is an extremely stable molecule, so incorporating it requires a very energetically favorable reaction. In the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis, that reaction involves linking the carbon dioxide as part of a reaction that breaks apart a modified five-carbon sugar, creating two three-carbon molecules. Some of those molecules get fed into the cell's metabolism, while others get built up into a five-carbon sugar again, restarting the cycle.\n\nIt works, but again, the central enzyme that incorporates the CO 2 is inefficient. And, as the researchers behind the new work note in a paper describing it, the three carbon molecules it produces aren't a great match for all of the cell's metabolism. The lipids used to make fats and the cell membrane are built up two carbons at a time. For that to work, plant cells actually oxidize a carbon back off, releasing carbon dioxide, in order to create a two-carbon source for building lipids.\n\n(For those of you who remember basic biochemistry, lipids are built using a molecule called acetyl Co-A, which has a two-carbon acetyl group attached to a larger molecule—the Co-A—that can easily be lopped off to combine the two carbons with other molecules.)\n\nSo, the team was interested in establishing something similar to the Calvin cycle, but capable of outputting a two-carbon molecule without re-emitting the carbon dioxide molecule that had just been captured. What they came up with is the malyl-­CoA-­glycerate cycle, which they fortunately abbreviated as the McG cycle so nobody would ever have to remember its real name. The reactions of the cycle (there are eight of them) are all catalyzed by existing enzymes, though those enzymes come from a number of different species, so they don't naturally occur together.\n\nCredit: Yu, et. al.\n\nThe McG cycle has a few very useful features. It spits out a two-carbon product at one of the steps, which can be directly used in the production of lipids. It also builds that molecule by incorporating carbon atoms at two different steps in the cycle, meaning a single cycle captures more carbon than gets taken up during the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis. (One of these is technically a bicarbonate molecule, which is produced when carbon dioxide dissolves in water.) Finally, there is a point in the McG cycle where it can exchange molecules with the Calvin cycle, allowing those two systems to interact and draw off any excess materials produced by either of them.\n\nIn 2018, the same lab tested the McG cycle in photosynthetic bacteria. In their new paper, they describe inserting all the genes into a plant cell and seeing how the plant responded. For testing purposes, they used a small weed named Arabidopsis that is a mainstay of plant research.\n\nAnd, well, it worked remarkably well. The plants carrying all the genes for the McG cycle weighed two to three times as much as control plants that only had some of the genes. They had more leaves, the leaves themselves were larger, and the plants produced more seeds. In a variety of growing conditions, the plants with an intact McG cycle incorporated more carbon, and they did so without increasing their water uptake.\n\nHaving a two-carbon output also worked as expected. By feeding the plants radioactive bicarbonate, they were able to trace the carbon showing up in the expected molecules. And imaging confirmed that the plants were making so many lipids that their cells formed internal pockets containing nothing but fatty materials. Triglyceride levels increased by factors of 100 or more.\n\nSo, by a variety of measures, the plants actually did better with an extra pathway for fixing carbon. There are a number of cautions, though. For starters, it's not clear whether what we're learning using a small weed will also apply to larger plants or crops, or really anything much beyond Arabidopsis at the moment. It could be that having excess globs of fat floating around the cell has consequences for something like a tree. Plants grown in a lab also tend to be provided with a nutrient-rich soil, and it's not clear whether all of this would apply to a range of real-world conditions.\n\nFinally, we can't say whether all the excess carbon these plants are sucking in from the atmosphere would end up being sequestered in any useful sense. It could be that all the fat would just get oxidized as soon as the plant dies. That said, there are a lot of approaches to making biofuel that rely on modifying the fats found in plants or algae. It's possible that this can eventually help make biofuels efficient so they actually have a net positive effect on the climate.\n\nRegardless of practical impacts, however, it's pretty amazing that we've now reached the point where we can fundamentally rewire a bit of metabolism that has been in operation for billions of years without completely messing up plants.\n\nScience, 2025.

    "title":"Small, affordable, efficient: A lot to like about the 2026 Nissan Leaf",
    "body":"Smaller on the outside, bigger on the inside, and it goes farther on a single charge.\n\nSAN DIEGO—The original Nissan Leaf was a car with a mission. Long before Elon Musk set his sights on Tesla selling vast numbers of electric vehicles to the masses, then-Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn wanted Nissan to shift half a million Leafs a year in the early 2010s. That didn't quite come to pass, but by 2020, it had sold its 500,000th EV, which went from its factory in Sunderland, England, to a customer in Norway.\n\nPioneering though they were, both first- and second-generation Leafs were compromised. They were adapted from existing internal combustion engine platforms, with the electric powertrains shoehorned inside. The cars' real handicaps were a lack of liquid cooling for the battery packs. Like an older Porsche 911, the Leaf was air-cooled, albeit with none of the collector value. That's all changed for generation three.\n\nThe new Leaf is built on a dedicated EV platform shared with Nissan's alliance partners Renault and Mitsubishi, and which we have previously seen used to good effect in the Nissan Ariya . The benefits of using a platform purpose-designed for electric propulsion are obvious from the space efficiency. The new car is 3 inches (75 mm) shorter from the outside, but offers nearly 9 inches (221 mm) more rear leg room (yes, really), making it a much more suitable place to put adults.\n\nAlthough the new Leaf is 0.8 inches (20 mm) wider, it's a few mm shorter and has a lower drag coefficient (Cd 0.26), so the overall effect is a more efficient shape. The nose bears a family resemblance to the Ariya, and the body style is sort of a crossover, sort of a fastback sedan, depending on your frame of reference.\n\nHere and there, you'll notice iconography that calls out the automaker's name: two vertical stripes (ni in Japanese), then three horizontal ones (san in Japanese). I'm told that if you look, there are some ginkgo leaves as Easter eggs hidden in the design, but I did not find them during our hours with the car.\n\nFor now, there's one powertrain option: a 214 hp (160 kW), 262 lb-ft (355 Nm) motor (packaged together with its inventor and reducer), powered by a 75 kWh (net) lithium-ion battery pack. The battery pack is integrated into the car's thermal management system, which also loops in the chiller, the motor, and the HVAC system. It can fast-charge at up to 150 kW via the NACS port built into its left side (or using a CCS1 adapter here) and should charge from 10–80 percent in 35 minutes. On the driver's side is a J1772 port for AC charging that can also work bidirectionally to send up to 1.5 kW of AC power to an external device via an adapter.\n\nNissan said it kept the J1772 port because it expects to sell the new Leaf to a lot of legacy customers who already have their own home charger, and it wanted to minimize the number of adapters necessary.\n\nHow far it goes on a single charge depends on which trim level you're in. Nissan brought some preproduction Leaf Platinum+ models to the first drive. These are very highly equipped, with an electrochromic dimming roof, the LED head- and taillights you see in the images, a couple of AC outlets inside the car (with the ability to power up to 3.4 kW across two outlets), and a better sound system. But it also comes on 19-inch alloy wheels, and as we all know, bigger wheels mean smaller range. Indeed, the Leaf Platinum+ has a range of 259 miles (417 km) on a single charge.\n\nThe $34,230 SV+ loses the panoramic roof and the interior V2L outlets, and you'll have to manually open and close the tailgate at the back. And the alloy wheels are an inch smaller, which increases the range to 288 miles (464 km).\n\nBut it keeps the heated front seats and the twin 14.3-inch displays (one for your instruments, one for infotainment) with Google built in. For the Platinum+ and SV+, that means onboard Google Maps with a route planner that will take into account your state of charge and which can precondition the battery if it knows your destination is a fast charger.\n\nNissan is only including the Google connected services for the first year, though—after that, owners will have to pay a monthly fee, although Nissan wasn't able to tell us how much that is. Conveniently, both wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are included and will continue to work after the year's trial. And you can manually precondition the battery for charging, but automatic preconditioning via the infotainment system will not work without an active subscription.\n\nThe SV+ and Platinum can also be optioned with a heat pump ($300).\n\nBut the $29,990 S+ cannot. And it lacks the twin displays of the car you see in the images, which means no automatic battery preconditioning, although like the more expensive trims it does still have wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. You also get 18-inch steel wheels with aero hubcaps, and a range of 303 miles (487 km) on a single charge. See what I mean about wheel size and range?\n\nI'd very much like to spend some time in an S+ and an SV+, if only to see what difference a larger tire sidewall makes to the ride comfort. On 19-inch wheels, the ride was firm and translated bumps and divots through the suspension and into the cabin. There wasn't much body roll, but your progress will be limited by the grip available to the low rolling-resistance tires—push too hard and the result is plenty of understeer.\n\nBut this is not a \"push too hard\" kind of EV. With just 214 hp, it accelerates quickly enough to get out of its own way, but it's telling that Nissan did not share a 0–60 mph time during the briefing. (If I had to guess, I'd say between 5–6 seconds, which used to be considered very rapid.)\n\nIt has four drive modes—Eco, Normal, Sport, and Personal—with three different throttle maps and two steering weights to choose from. And there are now four levels of lift-off regenerative braking, which you toggle on with the left steering wheel paddle and off with the right paddle. You can't turn regen completely off, so like General Motors' family of EVs, the Leaf will not really coast and loses a few mph even on downhill stretches, as it converts some kinetic energy to electrical energy.\n\nThere's also an e-Step button on the dash, which turns on maximum regen braking and may add some friction braking to the mix. Unlike using the paddles, this setting should remain on the next time you start the car. But neither of the full regen settings is able to bring the car to a complete stop—we were told that the feature is viewed with suspicion in some markets, including Japan, and like pop-out door handles, it appears that China is in the process of banning one-pedal driving entirely .\n\nBoth e-Step and max-regen work very well in traffic or on a twisty road, where they simulate engine braking. But given the choice, I would use the paddles to control regen braking. That's because, like the Mercedes EQ family of EVs, in this mode the brake pedal moves toward the firewall as the car slows. The engineer's excuse for this is that the pedal moves by the same distance it would have moved had the driver used it to slow the car by the amount it has just slowed. But my rebuttal is that the brake pedal should always be where I expect to find it in an emergency, and if that's an inch farther away, that's not cool.\n\nThat's really a minor gripe, though; no one says you have to push the e-Step switch on the dash. Slightly more annoying—but only slightly—is the wind noise from the sideview mirrors, which is noticeable even at 45 mph (72 km\/h), although easily drowned out if you're listening to something on the audio system.\n\nFor a daily driver, the third-generation Leaf is rather compelling, especially the S+, although the lack of heated front seats in that model might be too much of a deal-breaker, considering how important seat heaters are to EV efficiency in winter. (Because it's more efficient to heat the driver than warm all the air in the car.)\n\nThe SV+ is more likely to be the sweet spot—this trim level can have the Seabreeze paint you see here or a white pearl, which are alternatives to the four shades available to the S+. The Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV are probably the Leaf's two closest rivals, both of which are compelling cars. And the forthcoming Kia EV3 will probably also be cross-shopped. All of which is good news if you're looking for a smaller, affordable electric car.",

    "body":"Man agreed to return more than 1,000 stolen DVDs to his former employer.\n\nA former employee of a multinational DVD company was sentenced to four years in prison for stealing hundreds of pre-release DVDs and Blu-rays and leaking blockbuster movies online, the Department of Justice confirmed Thursday.\n\nBack in May, Steven Hale pleaded guilty to spending about a year between 2021 and 2022 stealing discs from his employer and selling them online through e-commerce sites. Among movies that Hale uploaded for illegal download were highly anticipated titles like Dune , as well as sequels to popular films like F9: The Fast Saga and Venom: Let There Be Carnage .\n\nBut according to the DOJ, Hale did the most damage by leaking advance copies of Spider-Man: No Way Home . That particular movie, released exclusively in theaters in 2021, became the first movie after the COVID pandemic started to gross $1 billion at the box office. Likely DVD sales were expected to be just as explosive, but for many fans too cautious to return to movie theaters at the time, DVD leaks became too enticing to pass up. Hale wasn't the only one to recognize the high demand online, with illegal downloads of the movie becoming so widespread that ReasonLabs reported that scammers started planting malware in illegal copies of the movie to \"lure in as many victims as possible.\"\n\nIt was in this climate that Hale bypassed DRM encryption, which prevents copying, to rip that movie from the Blu-ray disc, selling the high-quality leak online amidst a sea of inferior bootlegs , more than a month before fans could access it legally. Unsurprisingly, that DVD rip alone was \"downloaded tens of millions of times, with an estimated loss to the copyright owner of tens of millions of dollars,\" the DOJ said.\n\nHale, a 38-year-old with prior felony convictions for armed robbery, risked a potential sentence of 15 years for these crimes, but he reduced his sentence to a maximum of five years through his plea deal . At the time, the DOJ credited him for taking \"responsibility,\" arguing that he deserved a maximum reduction partly because the total \"infringement amount\" was likely no more than $40,000, not the \"tens of millions\" the DOJ claimed in today's release.\n\nUltimately, Hale pleaded guilty to criminal copyright infringement, while agreeing to pay restitution (the exact amount is not clarified in the release) and return \"approximately 1,160 stolen DVDs and Blu-rays\" that the cops seized to his former employer. Hale also pleaded guilty to \"being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm,\" the DOJ noted, after cops uncovered that he \"unlawfully possessed a pistol that was loaded with one live round in the chamber and 13 rounds in the magazine.\"\n\nCombining the DVD theft and firearm charges, the US District Court in Tennessee sentenced Hale to 57 months, just short of the five-year maximum sentence he could have faced.\n\nIn the DOJ's press release, acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti claimed the win, while warning that \"today’s sentencing signals our commitment to protecting American innovation from pirates that would exploit others’ work for a quick profit, which, in this case, cost one copyright owner tens of millions of dollars.”",

    "body":"North Korea test-fired a powerful new solid rocket motor for its next-generation ICBM.\n\nWelcome to Edition 8.10 of the Rocket Report! Dear readers, if everything goes according to plan, four astronauts are less than six months away from traveling around the far side of the Moon and breaking free of low-Earth orbit for the first time in more than 53 years. Yes, there are good reasons to question NASA's long-term plans for the Artemis lunar program — the woeful cost of the Space Launch System rocket, the complexity of new commercial landers, and a bleak budget outlook. But many of us who were born after the Apollo Moon landings have been waiting for this moment our whole lives. It is almost upon us.\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions . If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\nNorth Korea fires solid rocket motor. North Korea said Tuesday it had conducted the final ground test of a solid-fuel rocket engine for a long-range ballistic missile in its latest advancement toward having an arsenal that could viably threaten the continental United States, the Associated Press reports . The test Monday observed by leader Kim Jong Un was the ninth of the solid rocket motor built with carbon fiber and capable of producing 1,971 kilonewtons (443,000 pounds) of thrust, more powerful than past models, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.\n\nMobility and flexibility ... Solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, have advantages over liquid-fueled missiles, which have historically comprised the bulk of North Korea's inventory. Solid rocket motors can be stored for longer periods of time and are easier to conceal, transport, and launch on demand. The new solid rocket motor will be used on a missile called the Hwasong-20, according to North Korean state media. The AP reports some analysts say North Korea may conduct another ICBM test around the end of the year, showcasing its military strength ahead of a major ruling party congress expected in early 2026.\n\nAstrobotic eyes Andøya. US-based lunar logistics company Astrobotic and Norwegian spaceport operator Andøya Space have signed a term sheet outlining the framework for a Launch Site Agreement, European Spaceflight reports . The agreement, once finalized, will facilitate flights of Astrobotic's Xodiac lander testbed from the Andøya Space facilities. The Xodiac vertical takeoff, vertical landing rocket was initially developed by Masten Space Systems to simulate landing on the Moon and Mars. When Masten filed for bankruptcy in 2022, Astrobotic acquired its intellectual property and assets, including the Xodiac vehicle.\n\nAcross the pond ... So far, the small Xodiac rocket has flown on low-altitude atmospheric hops from Mojave, California, reaching altitudes of up to 500 meters, or 1,640 feet. The agreement between Astrobotic and Andøya paves the way for \"several\" Xodiac flight campaigns from Andøya Space facilities on the Norwegian coast. \"Xodiac's presence at Andøya represents a meaningful step toward delivering reliable, rapid, and cost-effective testing and demonstration capabilities to the European space market,\" said Astrobotic CEO John Thornton.\n\nUrsa Major breaks ground in Colorado. Ursa Major on Wednesday said it has broken ground on a new 400-acre site where it will test and qualify large-scale solid rocket motors for current and future missiles, including the Navy’s Standard Missile fleet, Defense Daily reports . The new site in Weld County, Colorado, north of Denver, will be ready for testing to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Ursa Major will be able to conduct full-scale static firings, and drop and temperature storage testing for current and future missile systems.\n\nSeeking SRM options ... Ursa Major said the new facility will support national and missile defense programs. The company's portfolio includes solid rocket motors (SRMs) ranging from 2 inches to 22 inches in diameter for missiles like the Stinger, Javelin, and air-defense interceptors. Ursa Major aims to join industry incumbents Northrop Grumman, L3Harris, and newcomer Anduril as a major supplier of SRMs to the government. \"This facility represents a major step forward in our ability to deliver qualified SRMs that are scalable, flexible, and ready to meet the evolving threat environment,\" said Dan Jablonsky, CEO of Ursa Major, in a statement. \"It’s a clear demonstration of our commitment and ability to rapidly advance and expand the American-made solid rocket motor industrial base that the country needs, ensuring warfighters will have the quality and quantity of SRMs needed to meet mission demands.\"\n\nFalcon 9 launches first satellites in a military megaconstellation. The first 21 satellites in a constellation that could become a cornerstone for the Pentagon's Golden Dome missile-defense shield were successfully launched from California on Wednesday aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Ars reports . The Falcon 9 took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, and headed south over the Pacific Ocean, reaching an orbit over the poles before releasing the 21 military-owned satellites to begin several weeks of activations and checkouts.\n\nFirst of many ... These 21 satellites will boost themselves to a final orbit at an altitude of roughly 600 miles (1,000 kilometers). The Pentagon plans to launch 133 more satellites over the next nine months to complete the build-out of the Space Development Agency's first-generation, or Tranche 1, constellation of missile-tracking and data-relay satellites. Military officials have worked for six years to reach this moment. The Space Development Agency (SDA) was established during the first Trump administration, which made plans for an initial set of demonstration satellites that launched a couple of years ago. In 2022, the Pentagon awarded contracts for the first 154 operational spacecraft, including the ones launched Wednesday. \"Back in 2019, when the SDA was stood up, it was to do two things. One was to make sure that we can do beyond line of sight targeting, and the other was to pace the threat, the emerging threat, in the missile-warning and missile-tracking domain. That's what the focus has been,\" said Gurpartap \"GP\" Sandhoo, the SDA's acting director.\n\nAnother Falcon 9 was delayed three times. SpaceX scrubbed launching a communications satellite from an Indonesian company for a third consecutive day on Wednesday, Spaceflight Now reports . Possible technical issues got in the way of a launch attempt after back-to-back days of weather delays at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida. The Falcon 9 finally launched Thursday evening with the Boeing-built Nusantara Lima communications satellite, targeting a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It’s the latest satellite from the Indonesian company Pasifik Satelit Nusantara.\n\nA declining market ... This was just the fifth geosynchronous communications satellite to launch on a commercial rocket this year, all by SpaceX. There were 21 such satellites that launched on commercial vehicles in 2015, including SpaceX's Falcon 9, Europe's Ariane 5, Russia's Proton, ULA's Atlas V, and Japan's H-IIA. Much of the world's launch capacity today is used to deploy smaller communications satellites into low-Earth orbit, primarily for broadband connectivity rather than for the video broadcast market once dominated by higher-altitude geosynchronous satellites.\n\nPutin urges Russia to build more rocket engines. Russian President Vladimir Putin urged aerospace industry leaders on September 5 to press on with efforts to develop booster rocket engines for space launch vehicles and build on Russia's longstanding reputation as a leader in space technology, Reuters reports . Putin, who spent the preceding days in China and the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok, flew to the southern Russian city of Samara, where he met industry specialists and toured the Kuznetsov design bureau engine manufacturing plant.\n\nA shell of its former self ... \"It is important to consistently renew production capacity in terms of engines for booster rockets,\" Russian news agencies quoted Putin as saying during the visit. \"And in doing so, we must not only meet our own current and future needs but also move actively on world markets and be successful competitors.\" The Kuznetsov plant in Samara builds medium-class RD-107 and RD-108 engines for Russia's Soyuz-2 rockets, which launch Russian military satellites and crew and cargo to the International Space Station. Their designs can be traced to the dawn of the Space Age nearly 70 years ago. Meanwhile, the outlook for heavier-duty Russian rocket engines is murky, at best. Russia's most-flown large rocket engine in the post-Cold War era, the RD-180, produced by a company called Energomash, is out of production after the end of sales to the United States.\n\nIndia nabs a noteworthy launch contract. Astroscale, a satellite servicing and space debris mitigation company based in Japan, has selected India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) to deliver a small satellite named ISSA-J1 to orbit in 2027. This is an interesting mission. The ISSA-J1 spacecraft will fly up to two large pieces of satellite debris in orbit to image and inspect them. ISSA-J1, developed in partnership with the Japanese government, is one in a series of Astroscale missions testing different ways of approaching, monitoring, capturing, and refueling other objects in space. The launch agreement was signed between Astroscale and NewSpace India Limited, the commercial arm of India's space agency.\n\nRideshare not an option ... \"We selected NSIL after thorough evaluations of more than 10 launch service providers over the past year, considering technical capabilities, track record, cost, and other elements,\" said Eddie Kato, president and managing director of Astroscale Japan. India's PSLV is right-sized for a mission like this. ISSA-J1 is a rarity in that it must launch on a dedicated rocket because it has to reach a specific orbit to line up with the pieces of space debris it will approach and inspect. Rideshare launches, such as those that routinely fly on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, are cheaper but go to standard orbits popular for many different types of satellite missions. A dedicated launch on a Falcon 9 would presumably have been more expensive than a flight on India's smaller PSLV. Rocket Lab's Electron, another rocket popular for dedicated launches of small satellites, lacks the performance required for Astroscale's mission.\n\nRussian cargo en route to ISS. Another cargo ship is flying to humanity's orbital outpost with the successful launch of Russia's Progress MS-32 supply freighter on Thursday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, NASASpaceflight.com reports . The supply ship launched aboard a Soyuz-2.1a rocket and arrived in orbit about nine minutes later, kicking off a two-day pursuit of the International Space Station. This was the 300th launch of an assembly, crew, or cargo mission to the ISS since 1998, including a handful of missions that didn't reach the complex due to rocket or spacecraft failures.\n\nImportant stuff ... The Progress MS-32 cargo craft will dock with the aft port of the space station's Russian Zvezda service module on Saturday. The payloads flying on the Progress mission include food, experiments, clothing, water, air, and propellant to be pumped into the space station's onboard tanks. The spacecraft will also reboost the lab's orbit.\n\nMetallic tiles? Not so great. It has been two weeks since SpaceX's last Starship test flight, and engineers have diagnosed issues with its heat shield, identified improvements, and developed a preliminary plan for the next time the ship heads into space, Ars reports . Bill Gerstenmaier, a SpaceX executive in charge of build and flight reliability, presented the findings Monday at the American Astronautical Society's Glenn Space Technology Symposium in Cleveland. The test flight went \"extremely well,\" Gerstenmaier said, but he noted some important lessons learned with the ship's heat shield.\n\nCrunch wrap reigns supreme ... \"We were essentially doing a test to see if we could get by with non-ceramic tiles, so we put three metal tiles on the side of the ship to see if they would provide adequate heat control, because they would be simpler to manufacture and more durable than the ceramic tiles. It turns out they're not,\" Gerstenmaier said. \"The metal tiles... didn't work so well.\" One bright spot with the heat shield was the performance of a new experimental material around and under the tiles. \"We call it crunch wrap,\" Gerstenmaier said. \"It's like a wrapping paper that goes around each tile.\" On the next Starship flight, SpaceX will likely cover more parts of the heat shield with this crunch wrap material. Gerstenmaier said the inaugural flight of Starship Version 3, with upgraded engines and more fuel, is now set to occur next year.\n\nAn SLS compromise might be afoot in DC. The Trump administration is seeking to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket after two more flights, but key lawmakers in Congress, including Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, aren't ready to go along.  So is this an impasse? Possibly not, as sources say the White House and Congress may not be all that far apart on how to handle this. The solution involves canceling part of the SLS rocket now, but not all of it, Ars reports .\n\nGoodbye EUS? ... The compromise might be to cancel a large new upper stage for the SLS rocket called the Exploration Upper Stage. This would save NASA billions of dollars, and the agency could instead procure commercial upper stages, such as those built by United Launch Alliance or Blue Origin, to fly on SLS rockets after NASA's Artemis III mission. It would also eliminate the need for NASA to finish building an expensive new launch tower at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The upper stage flying on the first three SLS missions is no longer in production. Sources indicated to Ars that Blue Origin has already begun work on a modified version of its New Glenn upper stage that could fit within the shroud of the SLS rocket.\n\nSept. 13: Soyuz-2.1b | Glonass-K1 No. 18L | Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia | 02:30 UTC\n\nSept. 13: Falcon 9 | Starlink 17-10 | Vandenberg Space Force Base, California | 15:41 UTC\n\nSept. 14: Falcon 9 | Cygnus NG-23 | Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida | 22:11 UTC",

    "title":"Jef Raskin’s cul-de-sac and the quest for the humane computer",
    "body":"“He wanted to make [computers] more usable and friendly to people who weren't geeks.”\n\nConsider the cul-de-sac. It leads off the main street past buildings of might-have-been to a dead-end disconnected from the beaten path. Computing history, of course, is filled with such terminal diversions, most never to be fully realized, and many for good reason. Particularly when it comes to user interfaces and how humans interact with computers, a lot of wild ideas deserved the obscure burials they got.\n\nBut some deserved better. Nearly every aspiring interface designer believed the way we were forced to interact with computers was limiting and frustrating, but one man in particular felt the emphasis on design itself missed the forest for the trees. Rather than drowning in visual metaphors or arcane iconographies doomed to be as complex as the systems they represented, the way we deal and interact with computers should stress functionality first, simultaneously considering both what users need to do and the cognitive limits they have. It was no longer enough that an interface be usable by a human—it must be humane as well.\n\nWhat might a computer interface based on those principles look like? As it turns out, we already know.\n\nThe man was Jef Raskin, and this is his cul-de-sac.\n\nIt's sometimes forgotten that Raskin was the originator of the Macintosh project in 1979. Raskin had come to Apple with a master's in computer science from Penn State University, six years as an assistant professor of visual arts at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and his own consulting company. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs subsequently hired Raskin's company to write the Apple II's BASIC programming manual, and Raskin joined Apple as manager of publications in 1978.\n\nRaskin's work on documentation and testing, combined with his technical acumen, gave him outsized influence within the young company. As the 40-column uppercase-only Apple II was ill-suited for Raskin's writing, Apple developed a text editor and an 80-column display card, and Raskin leveraged his UCSD contacts to port UCSD Pascal and the p-System virtual machine to the Apple II when Steve Wozniak developed the Apple II's floppy disk drives. (Apple sold this as Apple Pascal, and many landmark software programs like the Apple Presents Apple tutorial were written in it.)\n\nBut Raskin nevertheless concluded that a complex computer (by the standards of the day) could never exist in quantity, nor be usable by enough people to matter. In his 1979 essay “Computers by the Millions,” he argued against systems like the Apple II and the in-development Apple III that relied on expansion slots and cards for many advanced features. “What was not said was that you then had the rather terrible task of writing software to support these new 'boards,'” he wrote. “Even the more sophisticated operating systems still required detailed understanding of the add-ons… This creates a software nightmare.”\n\nInstead, he felt that “personal computers will be self-contained, complete, and essentially un-expandable. As we'll see, this strategy not only makes it possible to write complete software but also makes the hardware much cheaper and producible.” Ultimately, Raskin believed, only a low-priced, low-complexity design could be manufactured in large enough numbers for a future world and be functional there.\n\nThe original Macintosh was designed as an embodiment of some of these concepts. Apple chairman Mike Markkula had a $500 (around $2,200 in 2025) game machine concept in mind called “Annie,” named after the Playboy comic character and intended as a low-end system paired with the Apple II—starting at around double that price at the time—and the higher-end Apple III and Lisa, which were then in development. Raskin wasn't interested in developing a game console, but he did suggest to Markkula that a $500 computer could have more appeal, and he spent several months writing specifications and design documents for the proposed system before it was approved.\n\n“My message,” wrote Raskin in The Book of Macintosh , “is that computers are easy to use, and useful in everyday life, and I want to see them out there, in people's hands, and being used.” Finding female codenames sexist, he changed Annie to Macintosh after his favorite variety of apple, though using a variant spelling to avoid a lawsuit with the previously existing McIntosh Laboratory. (His attempt was ultimately for naught, as Apple later ended up having to license the trademark from the hi-fi audio manufacturer and then purchase it outright anyway.)\n\nRaskin's small team developed the hardware at Apple's repurposed original Cupertino offices separate from the main campus. Initially, he put together a rough all-in-one concept, originally based on an Apple II (reportedly serial number 2) with a “jury-rigged” monitor. This evolved into a prototype chiefly engineered by Burrell Smith, selecting for its CPU the 8-bit Motorola 6809 as an upgrade from the Apple II's MOS 6502 but still keeping costs low.\n\nSimilarly, a color display and a larger amount of RAM would have also added expense, so the prototype had a small 256x256 monochrome CRT driven by the ubiquitous Motorola 6845 CRTC, plus 64K of RAM. A battery and built-in printer were considered early on but ultimately rejected. The interface emphasized text and keyboard: There was no mouse, and the display was character-based instead of graphical.\n\nRaskin was aware of early graphical user interfaces in development, particularly Xerox PARC's, and he had even contributed to early design work on the Lisa, but he believed the mouse was inferior to trackballs and tablets and felt such pointing devices were more appropriate for graphics than text. Instead, function keys allowed the user to select built-in applications, and the machine could transparently shift between simple text entry or numeric evaluation in a “calculator-based language” depending on what the user was typing.\n\nDuring the project's development, Apple management had recurring concerns about its progress, and it was nearly canceled several times. This changed in late 1980 when Jobs was removed from the Lisa project by President Mike Scott, after which Jobs moved to unilaterally take over the Macintosh, which at that time was otherwise considered a largely speculative affair.\n\nRaskin initially believed the change would be positive, as Jobs stated he was only interested in developing the hardware, and his presence and interest quickly won the team new digs and resources. New team member Bud Tribble suggested that it should be able to take advantage of the Lisa's powerful graphics routines by migrating to its Motorola 68000, and by February 1981, Smith was able to duly redesign the prototype for the more powerful CPU while maintaining its lower-cost 8-bit data bus.\n\nThis new prototype expanded graphics to 384x256, allowed the use of more RAM, and ran at 8 MHz, making the prototype noticeably faster than the 5 MHz Lisa yet substantially cheaper. However, by sharing so much of Lisa's code, the interface practically demanded a pointing device, and the mouse was selected, even though Raskin had so carefully tried to avoid it. (Raskin later said he did prevail with Jobs on the mouse only having one button, which he believed would be easier for novices, though other Apple employees like Larry Tesler have contested his influence on this decision.)\n\nAs Jobs started to take over more and more portions of the project, the two men came into more frequent conflict, and Raskin eventually quit Apple for good in March 1982. The extent of Raskin's residual impact on the Macintosh's final form is often debated, but the resulting 1984 Macintosh 128K is clearly a different machine from what Raskin originally envisioned. Apple acknowledged Raskin's contributions in 1987 by presenting him with one of the six “millionth” Macintoshes, which he auctioned off in 1999 along with the Apple II used in the original concept.\n\nAfter Raskin's departure from Apple, he established Information Appliance, Inc. in Palo Alto to develop his original concept on his own terms. By this time, it was almost a foregone conclusion that microcomputers would sooner or later make their way to everyone; indeed, home computer pioneers like Jack Tramiel's Commodore were already selling inexpensive “computers by the millions”—literally. With the technology now evolving at a rapid pace, Raskin wanted to concentrate more on the user interface and the concept's built-in functionality, reviving the ideas he believed had become lost in the Macintosh's transition. He christened it with a new name: Swyft.\n\nIn terms of industrial design, the Swyft owed a fair bit to Raskin's prior prototype as it was also an all-in-one machine, using a built-in 9” monochrome CRT display. Unlike the Macintosh, however, the screen was set back at an angle and the keyboard was built-in; it also had a small handle at the base of its sloped keyboard making it at least notionally portable.\n\nDisk technology had advanced, so it sported a 3.5-inch floppy drive (also like the Macintosh, albeit hidden behind a door ), though initially the prototype used a less-powerful 8-bit MOS 6502 CPU running at 2MHz. The 6502's 64K addressing limit and the additional memory banking logic it required eventually proved inadequate, and the CPU was changed during development to the Motorola 68008, a cheaper version of the 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a maximum address space of 1MB. Raskin intended the Swyft to act like an always-on appliance, always ready and always instant, so it had a lower-power mode and absolutely no power switch.\n\nInstead of Pascal or assembly language, Swyft's ROM operating system was primarily written in Forth. To reduce the size of the compiled code, developer Terry Holmes created a “tokenized” version that embedded smaller tokens instead of execution addresses into Forth word definitions, trading the overhead of an additional lookup step (which was written in hand-coded assembly and made very quick) for a smaller binary size. This modified dialect was called tForth (for “token,” or “Terry”). The operating system supported the hardware and the demands of the on-screen bitmapped display, which could handle true proportional text.\n\nSwyft's user interface was also radically different and was based on a “document” metaphor. Most computers of that time and today, mobile devices included, divide functionality among separate applications that access files. Raskin believed this approach was excessive and burdensome, writing in 1986 that “[b]y choosing to focus on computers rather than the tasks we wanted done, we inherited much of the baggage that had accumulated around earlier generations of computers. It is more a matter of style and operating systems that need elaborate user interfaces to support huge application programs.”\n\nHe expanded on this point in his 2000 book The Humane Interface : “[Y]ou start in the generating application. Your first step is to get to the desktop. You must also know which icons correspond to the desired documents, and you or someone else had to have gone through the steps of naming those documents. You will also have to know in which folder they are stored.”\n\nRaskin thus conceived of a unified workspace in which everything was stored, accessed through one single interface appearing to the user as a text editor editing one single massive document. The editor was intelligent and could handle different types of text according to its context, and the user could subdivide the large document workspace into multiple subdocuments, all kept together. (This even included Forth code, which the user could write and evaluate in place to expand the system as they wished.) Data received from the serial port was automatically “typed” into the same document, and any or all text could be sent over the serial port or to a printer. Instead of function keys, a USE FRONT key acted like an Option or Command key to access special features.\n\nBecause everything was kept in one place, when the user saved the system state to a floppy disk, their entire workspace was frozen and stored in its entirety. Swyft additionally tagged the disk with a unique identifier so it knew when a disk was changed. When that disk was reinserted and resumed, the user picked up exactly where they left off, at exactly the same point, with everything they had been working on. Since everything was kept together and loaded en masse, there was no need for a filesystem.\n\nSwyft also lacked a mouse—or indeed any conventional means of moving the cursor around. To navigate through the document, Swyft instead had LEAP keys, which when pressed alone would “creep” forward or backward by single characters. But when held down, you could type a string of characters and release the key, and the system would search forward or backward for that string and highlight it, jumping entire pages and subdocuments if necessary.\n\nIf you knew what was in a particular subdocument, you could find it or just LEAP forward to the next document marker to scan through what was there. Additionally, by leaping to one place, leaping again to another, and then pressing both LEAP keys together, you could select text as well. The steps to send, delete, change, or copy anything in the document are the same for everything in the document. “So the apparent simplicity [of other systems] is arrived at only after considerable work has been done and the user has shouldered a number of mental burdens,” wrote Raskin, adding, “the conceptual simplicity of the methods outlined here would be preferable. In most cases, the work required is also far less.”\n\nWhile around 60 Swyft prototypes of varying functionality were eventually made, IAI's backers balked at the several million dollars additionally required to launch the product under the company's own name. To increase their chances of a successful return on investment, they demanded a licensee for the design instead that would insulate the small company from the costs of manufacturing and sales. They found it in Japanese manufacturer Canon, which had expanded from its core optical and imaging lines into microcomputers but had spent years unsuccessfully trying to crack the market. However, possibly because of its unusual interface, Canon unexpectedly put its electronic typewriter division in charge of the project, and the IAI team began work with Canon's engineers to refine the hardware for mass production.\n\nIn the meantime, IAI investors prevailed upon management to find a way to release some of the Swyft technology early in a less expensive incarnation. This concept eventually turned into an expansion card for the Apple IIe. Raskin's team was able to adapt some of the code written for the Swyft to the new device, but because the IIe is also a 6502-based system and is itself limited to a 64K address space, it required its own onboard memory banking hardware as well. With the card installed, the IIe booted into a scaled-down Swyft environment using its onboard 16K EPROM, with the option of disabling it temporarily to boot regular Apple software. Unlike the original Swyft, the Apple II SwyftCard does not use the bitmap display and appears strictly in 80-column non-proportional text. The SwyftCard went on sale in 1985 for $89.95, approximately $270 in 2025 dollars.\n\nThe SwyftCard's unified workspace can be subdivided into various “subdocuments,” which appear as hard page breaks with equals signs. Although up to 200 pages were supported, in practice, the available workspace limits you to about 15 or 20, “densely typed.” It came with a built-in tutorial which began with orienting you to the LEAP keys (i.e., the two Apple keys) and how to navigate: hold one of them down and type the text to leap to (or equals signs to jump to the next subdocument), or tap them repeatedly to slowly “creep.”\n\nSwyft and the SwyftCard implement a two-phased cursor, which the SwyftCard calls either “wide” or “narrow.” By default, the cursor is “narrow,” alternating between a solid and a partially filled block. As you type, the cursor splits into a “wide” form—any text shown in inverse, usually the last character you entered, is what is removed when you press DELETE, with the blinking portion after the inverse text indicating the insertion point. When you creep or leap, the cursor merges back into the “narrow” form. When narrow, DELETE deletes right as a true delete, instead of a backspace. If you selected text by pressing both LEAP keys together, those become highlighted in inverse and can be cut and pasted.\n\nThe SwyftCard software defines a USE FRONT key (i.e., the Control key) as well. This was most noticeable as a quick key combination for saving your work to disk, to which the entire workspace was saved in one go with no filenames (i.e., one disk equated one workspace), though it had many other such functions within the program. Since it could be tricky to juggle floppies without overwriting them, the software also took pains to ensure each formatted disk was tagged with a unique identifier to avoid accidental erasure. It also implemented serial communications such that you could dial up a remote system and use USE FRONT-SEND to send it or be dialed into and receive text into the workspace automatically.\n\nSwyftCards didn't sell in massive numbers, but their users loved them, particularly the speed and flexibility the system afforded. David Thornburg (the designer of the KoalaPad tablet), writing for A+ in November 1985, said it “accomplished something that I never knew was possible. It not only outperforms any Apple II word-processing system, but it lets the Apple IIe outperform the Macintosh… Will Rogers was right: it does take genius to make things simple.”\n\nThe Swyft and SwyftCard, however, were as much philosophy as interface; they represented Raskin's clear desire to “abolish the application.” Rather than starting a potentially different interface to do a particular task, the task should be part of the machine's standard interface and be launched by direct command. Similarly, even within the single user interface, there should be no “modes” and no switching between different minor behaviors: the interface ought to follow the same rules as much of the time as possible.\n\n“Modes are a significant source of errors, confusion, unnecessary restrictions, and complexity in interfaces,” Raskin wrote in The Humane Interface , illustrating it with the example of “at one moment, tapping Return inserts a return character into the text, whereas at another time, tapping Return cases the text typed immediately prior to that tap to be executed as a command.”\n\nEven a device as simple as a push-button flashlight is modal, argued Raskin, because “[i]f you do not know the present state of the flashlight, you cannot predict what a press of the flashlight's button will do.” Even if an individual application itself is notionally modeless, Raskin presented the real-world example of Command-N commonly used to open a new document but AOL's client using Command-M for a new E-mail message; the situation “that gives rise to a mode in this example consists of having a particular application active. The problem occurs when users employ the Command-N command habitually,” he wrote.\n\nUltimately, wrote Raskin, “[a]n interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.” In this case, the particular frailty Raskin concentrated on is the natural unconscious human tendency to form habitual behaviors. Because such habits are hard to break, command actions and gestures in an interface should be consistent enough that their becoming habitual makes them more effective, allowing a user to “do the task without having to think about it… We must design interfaces that (1) deliberately take advantage of the human trait of habit development and (2) allow users to develop habits that smooth the flow of their work.” If a task is always accomplished the same way, he asserted, then when the user has acquired the habit of doing so, they will have simultaneously mastered that task.\n\nRaskin's next computer preserved many such ideas from the Swyft, but it only did so in spite of the demands of Canon management, who forced multiple changes during development. Although the original Swyft (though not the SwyftCard) had true proportional text and at least the potential for user-created graphics, Canon's electric typewriter division was then in charge of the project and insisted on non-proportional fixed-width text and no graphics, because that's all the official daisywheel printer could generate—even though the system's bitmapped display remained. (A laser printer option was later added but was nevertheless still limited to text.)\n\nRaskin wanted to use a Mac-like floppy drive that could automatically detect floppy disk insertion, but Canon required the system to use their own floppy drives, which didn't. Not every change during development was negative. Much of the more complicated Swyft logic board was consolidated into smaller custom gate array chips for mass production, along with the use of a regular 68000 instead of the more limited 68008, which was also cheaper in volume despite only being run at 5MHz.\n\nHowever, against his repeated demands to the contrary and lengthy explanations of the rationale, Raskin was dismayed to find the device was nevertheless fitted with a power switch; Canon's engineering staff said they simply thought an error had been made and added it, and by then, it was too late in development to remove it.\n\nCanon management also didn't understand the new machine's design philosophy, treating it as an overgrown word processor (dubbed a “WORK Processor [sic]”) instead of the general-purpose computer Raskin intended, and required its programmability in Forth to be removed. This was unpopular with Raskin's team, so rather than remove it completely, they simply hid it behind an unlikely series of keystrokes and excised it from the manual. On the other hand, because Canon considered it an overgrown word processor, it seemed entirely consistent to keep the Swyft's primary interface intact otherwise, including its telecommunication features. The new system also got a new name: the Cat.\n\nThus was released the Canon Cat, announced in July 1987, for $1,495 (about $4,150 in 2025 dollars ). The released version came with 256K of RAM, with sockets to add an optional 128K more for 384K total, shared between the video circuitry, Forth dictionary, settings, and document text, all of which could be stored to the 3.5-inch floppy. (Another row of solder pads could potentially hold yet another 128K, but no shipping Cat ever populated it.)\n\nIts 256K of system ROM contained the entirety of the editor and tForth runtime, plus built-in help screens, all immediately available as soon as you turned it on. An additional 128K ROM provided a 90,000-word dictionary to which the user could add words that were also automatically saved to the same disk. The system and dictionary ROMs came in versions for US and UK English, French, and German.\n\nLike the Swyft it was based on, the Cat was an all-in-one system. The 9-inch monochrome CRT was retained, but the floppy drive no longer had a door, and the keyboard was extended with several special keys. In particular, the LEAP keys, as befitting their central importance, were given a row to themselves in an eye-catching shade of pink.\n\nFunction key combinations with USE FRONT are printed on the front of the keycaps. The Cat provided both a 1200 baud modem and a 9600bps RS-232 connector for serial data; it could dial out or be dialed into to upload text. Text transmitted to the Cat via the serial port was inserted into the document as if it had been typed in at the console. A Centronics-style printer port connected Canon's official printer options, though many printers were compatible.\n\nThe Cat can be (imperfectly) emulated with MAME; the Internet Archive has a preconfigured Wasm version with Canon ROMs that you can also run in your browser. Note that the current MAME driver, as of this writing, will freeze if the emulated Cat makes a beep, and the ROM's default keyboard layout assumes you're using a real Cat, not a PC or Mac. These minor issues can be worked around in the emulated Cat's setup menu by setting the problem signal to Flash (without a beep) and the keyboard to ASCII. The screenshots here are taken from MAME and adjusted to resemble the Cat's display aspect ratio.\n\nThe Swyft and SwyftCard's editing paradigm transferred to the Canon Cat nearly exactly. Preserved is the “wide” and “narrow” cursor, showing both the deletion range and the insertion point, as well as the use of the LEAP keys to creep, search, and select text ranges. (In MAME, the emulated LEAP keys are typically mapped to both Alt or Option keys.) SHIFT-LEAP can also be used to scroll the screen line by line, tapping LEAP repeatedly with SHIFT down to continue motion, and the Cat additionally implements a single level of undo with a dedicated UNDO key. The USE FRONT key also persisted, usually mapped in MAME to the Control key(s). Text could be bolded or underlined.\n\nSimilarly, the Cat inherits the same “multiple document interface” as the Swyfts: the workspace can be arbitrarily divided into documents, here using the DOCUMENT\/PAGE key (mapped usually to Page Down in MAME), and the next or previous document can be LEAPed to by using the DOCUMENT\/PAGE key as the target.\n\nHowever, the Cat has an expanded interface compared to the SwyftCard, with a ruler (in character positions) at the bottom, text and keyboard modes, and open areas for on-screen indicators when disk access or computations are in progress.\n\nAlthough Canon had mandated that the Cat's programmability be suppressed, the IAI team nevertheless maintained the ability to compute expressions, which Canon permitted as an extension of the editor metaphor. Simple arithmetic such as 355\/113 could be calculated in place by selecting the text and pressing USE FRONT-CALC (Control-G), which yields the answer with a dotted underline to indicate the result of a computation. (Here, the answer is computed to the default two decimal digits of precision, which is configurable.) Pressing USE FRONT-CALC within that answer reopens the expression to change it.\n\nComputations weren't merely limited to simple figures, though; the Cat also allowed users to store the result of a computation to a variable and reference that variable in other computations. If the variables underlying a particular computation were changed, its result would automatically update.\n\nThis capability, along with the Cat's non-proportional font, made it possible to construct simple spreadsheets right in the editor using nothing more than expressions and the TAB key to create rows and columns. Cells can be referred to by expressions in other cells using a special function use() with relative coordinates. Constant values in “cells” can simply be entered as plain text; if recalculation is necessary, USE FRONT-CALC will figure it out. The Cat could also maintain and sort simple line lists, which, when combined with the LEARN macro facility, could be used to automate common tasks like mail merges.\n\nThe Cat also maintained an extensive set of help screens built into ROM that the SwyftCard, for capacity reasons, was forced to load from floppy disk. Almost every built-in function had a documentation screen accessible from USE FRONT-HELP (Control-N): keep USE FRONT down, release the N key, and then press another key to learn about it. When the USE FRONT key is also released, the Cat instantly returns to the editor. Similarly, if the Cat beeped to indicate an error, pressing USE FRONT-HELP could also explain why. Errors didn't trigger a modal dialogue or lock out system functions; you could always continue.\n\nInternally, the current workspace contained not only the visible text documents but also any custom words the user added to the dictionary and any additional tForth words defined in memory. Ordinarily, there wouldn't be any, given that Canon didn't officially permit the user to program their own software, but there were a very small number of software applications Canon itself distributed on floppy disk: CATFORM, which allowed the user to create, fill out, and print form templates, and CATFILE, Canon's official mailing list application. Dealers were instructed to provide new users with copies, though the Cat here didn't come with them. Dealers also had special floppies of their own for in-store demos and customization.\n\nStill, IAI's back door to Forth quietly shipped in every Cat, and the clue was a curious omission in the online help: USE FRONT-ANSWER. This otherwise unexplained and unused key combination was the gateway. If you entered the string Enable Forth Language , highlighted it, and evaluated it with USE FRONT-ANSWER (not CALC; usually Control-Backspace in MAME), you'd get a Forth ok prompt, and the system was now yours. Reset the Cat or type re to return to the editor.\n\nWith Forth enabled, you could either enter code at the prompt, or do so within the editor and press USE FRONT-ANSWER to evaluate it, putting any output into the document just like Applesoft BASIC did on the SwyftCard. Through the Forth interface it was possible to define your own words, saved as part of the workspace, or even hack in 68000 machine code and completely take control of the machine . Extensive documentation on the Cat's internals eventually surfaced , but no third-party software was ever written for the platform during its commercial existence.\n\nAs it happened, whatever commercial existence the Cat did have turned out to be brief and unprofitable anyway. It sold badly, blamed in large part on Canon's poor marketing, which positioned it as an expensive dedicated word processor in an era where general-purpose PCs and, yes, Macintoshes were getting cheaper and could do more.\n\nVarious apocryphal stories circulate about why the Cat was killed—one theory cites internal competition between the typewriter and computer divisions; another holds that Jobs demanded the Cat be killed if Canon wanted a piece of his new venture, NeXT (and Owen Linzmeyer reports that Canon did indeed buy a 16 percent stake in 1989)—but regardless of the reason, it lasted barely six months on the market before it was canceled. The 1987 stock market crash was a further blow to the small company and an additional strain on its finances.\n\nDespite the Cat's demise, Raskin's team at IAI attempted to move forward with a successor machine, a portable laptop that would have reportedly weighed just four pounds. The new laptop, christened the Swyft III, used a ROM-based operating system based on the Cat's but with a newer, more sophisticated “leaping” technology called Hyperleap. At $999, it was to include a 640x200 supertwist LCD, a 2400 bps modem and 512K of RAM (a smaller $799 Swyft I would have had less memory and no modem), as well as an external floppy drive and an interchange facility for file transfers with PCs and Macs.\n\nAs Raskin had originally intended, the device achieved its claimed six-hour battery life (NiCad or longer with alkaline) primarily by aggressively sleeping when idle but immediately resuming full functionality when a key was pressed. Only two prototypes were ever made before IAI's investors, considering the company risky after the Cat's market failure and little money coming in, finally pulled the plug and caused the company to shut down in 1992. Raskin retained patents on the “leaping” method and the Swyft\/Cat's means of saving and restoring from disk, but their subsequent licensees did little with the technology, and the patents in the present day have lapsed.\n\nThe Cat is probably the best known of Raskin's designs (notwithstanding the Macintosh, for reasons discussed earlier), especially as Raskin never led the development of another computer again. Nevertheless, his interface ideas remained influential, and after IAI's closing, he continued as an author and frequent consultant and reviewer for various consumer products. These observations and others were consolidated into his later book The Humane Interface , from which this article has already liberally quoted. On the page before the table of contents, the book observes that “[w]e are oppressed by our electronic servants. This book is dedicated to our liberation.”\n\nIn The Humane Interface , Raskin not only discusses concepts such as leaping and habitual command behaviors but means of quantitative assessment as well. One of the more well-known is Fitts' Law, after psychologist Paul Fitts, Jr., that predicts the time needed to quickly move to a target area is correlated with both the size of the target and its distance from the starting position.\n\nThis has been most famously used to justify the greater utility of a global menu bar completely occupying the edge of a screen (such as in macOS) because the mouse pointer stops at the edge, making the menu bar effectively infinitely large and therefore easy to “hit.” Similarly, Hick's law (or the Hick-Hyman law, named for psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman) asserts that increasing the number of choices a user is presented with will increase their decision time logarithmically. Given experimental constants, both laws can predict how long a user will need to hit a target or make a choice.\n\nNotably, none of Raskin's systems (at least as designed) superficially depended on either law because they had no explicit pointing device and no menus to select from. A more meaningful metric he also considers might be the Card-Moran-Newell GOMS model (“goals, objects, methods and selection rules”) and how it applies to user motion. While the time needed to mentally prepare, press a key, point to a particular position on the display or move from input device to input device (say, mouse to-and-from keyboard) will vary from person to person, most users will have similar times, and general heuristics exist (e.g., nonsense is easier to type than structured data).\n\nHowever, the length of time the computer takes to respond is within the designer's control, and its perception can be reduced by giving prompt and accurate feedback, even if the operation's actual execution time is longer. Similarly, if we reduce keystrokes or reduce having to move from mouse to keyboard for a given task, the total time to perform that task becomes less for any user.\n\nAlthough these timings can help to determine experimentally which interface is better for a given task, Raskin points out we can use the same principles to also determine the ideal efficiency of such interfaces. An interface that gives the user no choices but still must be interacted with is maximally inefficient because the user must do some non-zero amount of work to communicate absolutely no information.\n\nA classic example might be a modal alert box with only one button—asynchronous or transparent notifications could be better used instead. Likewise, an interface with multiple choices will nevertheless become less efficient if certain choices are harder or more improbable to access, such as buttons or click areas being smaller than others, or a particular choice needing more typing to select than other choices.\n\nRaskin's book also considers alternative means of navigation, pointing out that “natural” and “intuitive” are not necessarily synonyms for “easy to use.” (A mouse can be easy to use, but it's not necessarily natural or intuitive. Recall Scotty in Star Trek IV picking up the Macintosh Plus mouse and talking to it instead of trying to move it, and then eventually having to use the keyboard. Raskin cites this very scene, in fact.)\n\nBesides leaping, Raskin also presents the idea of a zooming user interface (ZUI), allowing the user an easier way to not only reach their goal but also see themselves in relationship to that goal and within the entire workspace. If you see what you want, zoom in. If you've lost your place, zoom out. One could access a filesystem this way, or a collection of applications or associated websites. Raskin was hardly the first to propose the ZUI—Ivan Sutherland developed a primitive ZUI for graphics in his 1962 Sketchpad, along with the Spatial Dataland at MIT and Xerox PARC's Smalltalk with “infinite” desktops—but he recognized its unique abilities to keep a user mentally grounded while navigating large structures that would otherwise become unwieldy. This, he asserts, made it more humane.\n\nTo crystallize these concepts, rather than create another new computer, Raskin instead started work on a software package with a team that included his son, Aza, initially called The Humane Environment. THE's HumaneEditorProject was first unveiled to the world on Christmas Eve 2002, though initially only as a SourceForge CVS tree, since it was considered very unfinished. The original early builds of the Humane Editor were open-source and intended to run on classic Mac OS 9, though QEMU, SheepShaver and Classic under Tiger and earlier will also run it.\n\nAs before, the Humane Editor uses a large central workspace subdivided into individual documents, here separated by backtick characters. Our familiar two-tone cursor is also maintained. However, although font sizes, boldface, italic, and underlining were supported, colors (and, additionally, font sizes) were still selected by traditional Mac pulldown menus.\n\nLeaping, here with a trademark, is again front and center in THE. However, instead of dedicated keys, leaping is merely a part of THE's internal command line, termed the Humane Quasimode, where other commands can be sent. Notice that the prompt is displayed as translucent text over the work area.\n\nWhen text was deleted, either by backspacing over it or pressing DELETE with a selected region, it went to an automatically created and maintained “DELETION DOCUMENT” from which it could be rescued. Effectively, this turned the workspace into a yank buffer along with all your documents, and undoing any destructive editing operation thus became merely another cut and paste. (Deleting from the deletion document just deleted.)\n\nA full list of commands accepted by the Quasimode was available by typing COMMANDS, which in turn emitted them to the document. These are based on precompiled Python files, which the user could edit or add to, and arbitrary Python expressions and code could also be inserted and run from the document workspace directly.\n\nTHE was a fully functioning editor, albeit incomplete, but nevertheless capable enough to write its own documentation with. Despite that, the intention was never to make something that was just an editor, and this aspiration became more obvious as development progressed. To make the software available on more platforms, development subsequently changed to wxPython in 2004, and later Python and Pygame to handle the screen display. The main development platform switched at the same time to Windows, and a Windows demo version of this release was made , although Mac OS X and Linux could still theoretically run it if you installed the prerequisites.\n\nWith the establishment of the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces (RCHI) , THE's development continued under a new name, Archy. (This Wayback Machine link is the last version of the site before it was defaced and eventually domain-parked.) The new name was both a pun on “RCHI” and a reference to the Don Marquis characters, Archy and Mehitabel , specifically Archy the typewriting cockroach, whose alleged writings largely lack capital letters or punctuation because he couldn't hit the SHIFT key at the same time. Archy's final release shown here was the unfinished build 124, dated December 15, 2005.\n\nArchy had come a long way from the original Mac THE, finally including the same sort of online help tutorial that the SwyftCard and Cat featured. It continued the use of a dedicated key to enter commands—in this case, CAPS LOCK. Hold it down, type the command, and then release it.\n\nLikewise, dedicated LEAP keys returned in Archy, in this case Left and Right Alt, and as before, selection was done by pressing both LEAP keys. A key advancement here is that any text that would be selected, if you chose to select it, is highlighted beforehand in a light shade of yellow so you no longer had to remember where your ranges were.\n\nAs before, the COMMANDS verb gave you a list of commands. While THE's command suite was almost entirely specific to an editor application, Archy's aspirations as a more complete all-purpose environment were evident. In particular, in addition to many of the same commands we saw on the Mac, there were now special Internet-oriented commands like EMAIL and GOOGLE. These commands were now just small documents containing Python embedded in the same workspace—no more separate files you had to corral. You could even change built-in commands, and even LEAP itself.\n\nAs you might expect, besides the deletion document (now just “DELETIONS”), things like your email were also now subdocuments, and your email server settings were a subdocument, too. While this was never said explicitly, a logical extension of the metaphor would have been to subsume webpage contents as in-place parts of the workspace as well—your history, bookmarks, and even the pages themselves could be subdocuments of their own, restored immediately and ready for access when entering Archy. Each time you exited, the entire workspace was saved out into a versioned file, so you could even go back in time to a recent backup if you blew it.\n\nRaskin was found to have pancreatic cancer in December 2004 and, after transitioning the project to become Archy the following January, died shortly afterward on February 26, 2005. In Raskin's New York Times obituary, Apple software designer Bill Atkinson lauded his work, saying, “He wanted to make them [computers] more usable and friendly to people who weren't geeks.” Technology journalist Steven Levy agreed, adding that “[h]e really spent his life urging a degree of simplicity where computers would be not only easy to use but delightful.” He left behind his wife Linda Blum and his three children, Aza, Aviva, and Aenea.\n\nArchy was the last project Raskin was directly involved in, and to date it remains unfinished. Some work continued on the environment after his death—this final release came out in December 2005, nearly 10 months later—but the project was ultimately abandoned, and many planned innovations, such as a ZUI of its own, were never fully developed beyond a separate proof of concept.\n\nSimilarly, many of Raskin's more unique innovations have yet to reappear in modern mainstream interfaces. RCHI closed as well and was succeeded in spirit by the Chicago-based Humanized, co-founded by his son Aza. Humanized reworked ideas from Archy into Enso , which expanded the CAPS LOCK-as-command interface with a variety of verbs such as OPEN (to start applications) and DEFINE (to get the dictionary definition of a word), and the ability to perform direct web searches.\n\nBy using a system-wide translucent overlay similar to Archy and THE, the program was intended to minimize the need for switching back and forth between multiple applications to complete a task. In 2008, Enso was made free for download, and Humanized's staff joined Mozilla, where the concept became a Firefox browser extension called Ubiquity , in which web-specific command verbs could be written in JavaScript and executed in an opaque pop-up window activated by a hotkey combination. However, the project was placed on “indefinite hiatus” in 2009 and was never revisited, and it no longer works with current versions of the browser.\n\nThe idea of a single workspace that you “leap through” also never resurfaced. Likewise, although ZUI-like animations have appeared more or less as eye candy in environments such as iOS and GNOME, a pervasive ZUI has yet to appear in (or as) any major modern desktop environment. That said, the idea is visually appealing, and some specific applications have made heavier use of the concept.\n\nMicrosoft's 2007 Deepfish project for Windows Mobile conceived of visually shrunken webpages for mobile devices that users could zoom into, but it was dependent on a central server and had high bandwidth requirements, and Microsoft canceled it in 2008. A Swiss company named Raskin Software LLC (apparently no official relation) offers a macOS ZUI file and media browser called Raskin , which has free and paid tiers; on other platforms, the free open-source Eagle Mode project offers a similar file manager with media previews, but also a chess application, a fractal viewer, and even a Linux kernel configuration tool.\n\nPerhaps the most complete example of an operating environment built around a ZUI might be A2, a branch of the ETH-Zürich Oberon System. The Oberon System, based around the Oberon programming language descended from Modula-2 and Pascal, was already notable for its unique paneled text user interface, where text is clickable, including text you type; Native Oberon can be booted directly as an operating system by itself.\n\nIn 2002, A2 spun off initially as Active Object System, using an updated dialect called Active Oberon supporting improved scheduling, exception handling, and object-oriented programming with processes and threads able to run within an object's context to make that object “active.” While A2 kept the Oberon System's clickable text metaphor, windows and gadgets can also be zoomed in or out of on an infinitely scrolling desktop, which is best appreciated in action . It is still being developed , and older live CDs are still available . However, the Oberon System has never achieved general market awareness beyond its small niche, and any forks less so, limiting it to a practical curiosity for most users.\n\nThis isn't to say that Raskin's quest for a truly humane computer has completely come to naught. Unfortunately, in some respects, we're truly backsliding, with opaque operating systems that can limit your application choices or your ability to alter or customize them, and despite very public changes in skinning and aesthetics, the key ways that we interact with our computers have not substantially changed since the wide deployment of the Xerox PARC-derived “WIMP” paradigm (windows, icons, menus and pointers)—ironically most visibly promoted by the 1984 post-Raskin Macintosh.\n\nA good interface unavoidably requires work and study, two things that take too long in today's fast-paced product cycle. Furthermore, Raskin's emphasis on built-in programmability nevertheless rings a bit quaint in our era, when many home users' only computer may be a tablet. By his standards, there is little humane about today's computers, and they may well be less humane than yesterday's.\n\nNevertheless, while Raskin's ideas may have few present-day implementations, that doesn't mean the spirit in which they were proposed is dead, too. At the very least, some greater consideration is given to the traditional WIMP paradigm's deficiencies today, particularly with multiple applications and windows, and how it can poorly serve some classes of users, such as those requiring assistive technology. That said, I hold guarded optimism about how much change we'll see in mainstream systems, and Raskin's editor-centric, application-less interface becomes more and more alien the more the current app ecosystem reigns dominant.\n\nBut as cul-de-sacs go, you can pick far worse places to get lost in than his, and it might even make it out to the main street someday. Until then, at least, you can always still visit—in an upcoming article, we'll show you how.\n\nFolklore.org\n\nCanonCat.net\n\nLinzmeyer, Owen W (2004). Apple Confidential 2.0.

    "body":"Companies work to finalize terms as OpenAI pursues for-profit restructuring.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI and Microsoft announced they have signed a non-binding agreement to revise their partnership, marking the latest development in a relationship that has grown increasingly complex as both companies compete for customers in the AI market and seek new partnerships for growing infrastructure needs.\n\n\"Microsoft and OpenAI have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership,\" the companies wrote in a joint statement. \"We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone, grounded in our shared commitment to safety.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as OpenAI seeks to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, a transition that requires Microsoft's approval, as the company is OpenAI's largest investor, with more than $13 billion committed since 2019.\n\nThe partnership has shown increasing strain as OpenAI has grown from a research lab into a company valued at $500 billion. Both companies now compete for customers, and OpenAI seeks more compute capacity than Microsoft can provide. The relationship has also faced complications over contract terms, including provisions that would limit Microsoft's access to OpenAI technology once the company reaches so-called AGI (artificial general intelligence)—a nebulous milestone both companies now economically define as AI systems capable of generating at least $100 billion in profit.\n\nIn May, OpenAI abandoned its original plan to fully convert to a for-profit company after pressure from former employees, regulators, and critics, including Elon Musk. Musk has sued to block the conversion, arguing it betrays OpenAI's founding mission as a nonprofit dedicated to benefiting humanity.\n\nThe company instead announced a modified approach where the nonprofit board would retain control while converting its for-profit subsidiary into a public benefit corporation . Under this revised structure, the nonprofit would become the largest shareholder, with a stake worth more than $100 billion, according to OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor's announcement in May. Thursday's MOU with Microsoft suggests the companies are working to align on this modified restructuring plan.\n\nThe restructuring still requires approval from attorneys general in California and Delaware, who continue to scrutinize the proposed conversion. A coalition of charitable institutions has also called on regulators to halt the plan.\n\nMicrosoft stated in a January blog post that key elements of the partnership remain in place through 2030, including access to OpenAI's intellectual property, revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusivity on OpenAI's APIs. That agreement introduced a right of first refusal model for compute capacity, replacing Microsoft's previous exclusivity as OpenAI's sole cloud provider.\n\nThe rapidly changing relationship between two formerly steadfast partners follows the AI industry's explosive growth from experimental research labs to multi-hundred-billion-dollar infrastructure investments over the past six years since the two companies first made an investment deal. OpenAI has diversified its infrastructure partnerships, including participation in the $500 billion Stargate Project with Oracle and SoftBank, while Microsoft has expanded Azure to host competing models from Meta, xAI, and DeepSeek.\n\nDespite efforts by both companies to reduce mutual dependence, their fortunes remain deeply intertwined. Microsoft disclosed in recent earnings that Azure has become a $75 billion annual business, with significant contributions from OpenAI-related services.",

    "body":"SSPE is a rare but always fatal disease that destroys a child's brain.\n\nA child in Los Angeles has died of a measles-related brain disorder stemming from an infection in infancy, the Los Angeles County health department reported Thursday .\n\nSpecifically, the child died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but always fatal complication that strikes years after an initial measles infection. The health department's announcement offered few details about the child, including the child's age, but said that the child had contracted the virus before they were old enough to be vaccinated against measles. The first of two recommended doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is given between 12 and 15 months.\n\n\"This case is a painful reminder of how dangerous measles can be, especially for our most vulnerable community members,\" Muntu Davis, a Los Angeles County health officer, said in a statement. \"Infants too young to be vaccinated rely on all of us to help protect them through community immunity. Vaccination is not just about protecting yourself—it's about protecting your family, your neighbors, and especially children who are too young to be vaccinated.\"\n\nSSPE is caused by a persistent measles infection in the central nervous system. Children infected with the virus may go through the standard disease progression—flu-like symptoms, high fever, the telltale rash—and then appear to fully recover. But, for a small few, the virus remains, and SSPE emerges years later, often seven to 10 years after the initial infection.\n\nThe Los Angeles health department noted that SSPE generally affects about 1 in 10,000 people with measles, but the risk may be much higher—about 1 in 600—for those who get measles as infants, such as the child who recently died.\n\nWith widespread vaccination, which led to measles being declared eliminated from the US in 2000, SSPE has virtually disappeared in the US. However, with vaccination rates slipping and anti-vaccine misinformation and views gripping the country, health experts fear seeing more of these devastating cases. Already, the US measles case count for the year is at a 33-year high , and two other children, as well as an adult, died from the acute infection this year.\n\nSymptoms of SSPE emerge in horrifying stages , starting with mood and personality changes, including depression. Then, uncontrolled, jerky movements develop as well as vision loss, dementia, and seizures. In the third stage, jerky movements become writhing and rigidity. In the last stage, the parts of the brain that regulate breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged, leading to coma and death. The timeline for the stages varies widely, as does the exact presentation.\n\nBut a heart-wrenching 2016 case report of a boy in Oregon detailed the horrors of what the disease can look like. The boy, who was 14 when he died, had contracted measles in the Philippines as a 1-year-old. His SSPE symptoms began at age 11, when he was a straight-A fifth grader who played soccer and basketball. He began to struggle with homework, drop utensils, and fall asleep during meals and even while walking. Over the next month, he became less alert and seemed confused. He started having jerky movements. He lost his appetite and his weight dropped 12 pounds. He could no longer go to school and had a home tutor.\n\nNext, he developed repetitive behaviors, couldn't sit still, frequently fell, and asked seemingly meaningless questions. He became aggressive and could no longer be tutored. He started shuffling and walking on his toes before refusing to walk altogether. He cried continuously, became increasingly aggressive, and began sleeping for long periods. His speech declined as did his mental status. He became incontinent and was unable to eat or drink. In the final stage, about four and a half months after the symptoms began, he could no longer follow objects with his eyes, didn't seem to recognize his family members’ faces or voices, and was unresponsive to questions.\n\nWith no treatment for SSPE, he was discharged from the hospital to home hospice care and died 43 months later in 2015.\n\n\"This case underscores the importance of maintaining high population immunity, through routine administration of 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine to all eligible children,\" the authors of the boy's case report concluded.",

    "title":"NASA found intriguing rocks on Mars, so where does that leave Mars Sample Return?",
    "body":"\"I have to look at dollars, and I have to look at time, and I have to look at return.\"\n\nNASA's interim administrator, Sean Duffy, was fired up on Wednesday when he joined a teleconference to talk about new scientific findings that concerned the potential for life to have once existed on Mars.\n\n\"This is exciting news,\" said Duffy about an arrow-shaped rock on Mars found by NASA's Perseverance rover. The rock contained chemical signatures and structures that could have been formed by ancient microbial life. The findings were intriguing, but not conclusive. Further study of the rocks in an advanced lab on Earth might prove more definitive.\n\nDuffy was ready, he said, to discuss the scientific results along with NASA experts on the call with reporters. However, the very first question—and for any space reporter, the obvious one—concerned NASA's on-again, off-again plan to return rocks from the surface of Mars for study on Earth. This mission, called Mars Sample Return, has been on hold for nearly two years after an independent analysis found that NASA's bloated plan would cost at least $8 billion to $11 billion. President Trump has sought to cancel it outright.\n\n\"What's the latest on NASA's plans to retrieve the samples from Perseverance?\" asked Marcia Dunn, a reporter with the Associated Press, about small vials of rocks collected by the NASA rover on Mars.\n\n\"So listen, we're looking at how we get this sample back, or other samples back,\" Duffy replied. \"What we're going to do is look at our budget, so we look at our timing, and you know, how do we spend money better? And you know, what technology do we have to get samples back more quickly? And so that's a current analysis that's happening right now.\"\n\nA couple of questions later, Ken Chang, a science reporter with The New York Times, asked Duffy why President Trump's budget request called for the cancellation of Mars Sample Return and whether that was still the president's intent.\n\n\"I want to be really clear,\" Duffy replied. \"This is a 30-year process that NASA has undertaken. President Trump didn't say, 'Hey, let's forget about Mars.' No, we're continuing our exploration. And by the way, we've been very clear under this president that we don't want to just bring samples back from Mars. We want to send our boots to the Moon and to Mars, and that is the work that we're doing. Amit (Kshatriya, the new associate administrator of NASA) even said maybe we'll send our equipment to test this sample to Mars itself. All options are on the table.\"\n\nSo that was a couple of questions asking about a robotic Mars Sample Return mission, which, under NASA's most recent plan, was slated to launch no earlier than 2030. Duffy still offered no real answers beyond a vague we're looking at it . Since China now says it will launch a Mars sample return mission in 2028, I asked Duffy a few minutes later whether this administration was comfortable with its geopolitical rival achieving such a spaceflight feat first.\n\n\"First, Eric, I love you guys all asking me questions,\" Duffy replied. \"We got some of the brightest people at NASA with us. I'll take them. I was hoping your questions are going to be more on, you know, more on this exciting news that we have today. But you know, listen, we're running our plan. We're making the right calls for America and for our partners. And again, we lead, and we are going to continue to lead, but it's always important that we keep pushing. We have to push because we are in another space race. I want to make sure we're making the right decisions, right, and I have to look at dollars, and I have to look at time, and I have to look at return. And as we do that, we thought, well, there could be a better way to do this, to get these samples back.\"\n\nDuffy should not be surprised that reporters were addressing questions directly to him. Since he was named as interim NASA administrator (a former congressman, Duffy is also currently the US secretary of transportation) on July 9, Duffy has participated in no NASA news conferences, and outside of appearances on Fox News, has conducted a very limited number of interviews. So it is natural that, during his first appearance before reporters, he received a majority of the questions.\n\nDuffy is not wrong that a new leader of NASA should be reviewing the agency's decisions, especially in light of the competition between the United States and China, to ensure taxpayers are getting a great return on their investment in the US space agency.\n\nWhat does seem clear after this week is that, despite a line in the president's budget request for fiscal year 2026 calling for the cancellation of NASA's Mars Sample Return mission, Duffy is open to negotiating with Congress about the best path forward. But he's not ready to talk about it yet. However, based upon discussions with several sources, there appear to be three potential paths that NASA is considering:\n\nIt has already been a turbulent year for the Trump administration and NASA's science programs. The White House, NASA, and Congress already face a host of thorny questions about the future of more than two dozen science missions. The White House wants to essentially turn off a number of spacecraft already operating in space. It has also sought to cut funding for the Perseverance rover, which made this significant discovery.\n\nBecause of these pending fights, it seems like a resolution on Mars Sample Return may not come for some time.",

    "title":"The 14 Best Healthy Beverages for Staying Hydrated With Added Benefits",
    "body":"Looking to cut out sugary sodas or energy drinks, but don't enjoy drinking plain water? There are now plenty of healthy drinks out there for those who want a fun beverage without the added sugar or calories. Some contain probiotics for gut health, electrolytes for hydration, magnesium for relaxation and other ingredients that aim to give your body a boost. After years of testing various drinks as wellness editors, these are the best healthy beverages we keep buying with our own money.\n\nFor this list, we didn’t choose a best healthy beverage overall because each drink offers something unique. Some have probiotics, while others offer magnesium or electrolytes. We felt it would be unfair to choose the best overall and instead went with each drink’s individual category.\n\nWhy we like it: Created in 2018, you’ve likely seen Olipop pop up in your local grocery or health food store. The soda contains prebiotics , botanicals and plant fiber to support digestive health. It’s also low-sugar, high-fiber , low-calorie, vegan, gluten-free and GMO-free, and it contains no artificial sweeteners, preservatives, flavors or colors. It’s marketed as a “new kind of soda” meant to be good for you while tasting good, too.\n\nI’ve been a fan of Olipop for years. The brand recently sent me its tropical punch, vintage cola, root beer, cream soda, classic grape, orange squeeze, Doctor Goodwin and lemon-lime sodas, but I have also purchased the following flavors on my own: peaches and cream, strawberry vanilla, cherry cola, watermelon lime, banana cream, cherry vanilla, crisp apple and Ridge Rush. I enjoyed all of these flavors and found that they are perfect in mocktails, whether they are the base of the drink or added alongside a nonalcoholic liquor .\n\nMy favorites are strawberry vanilla, orange squeeze and lemon-lime.\n\nWho is it best for: This soda is best for people who enjoy the flavor and sparkling nature of soda, but want to avoid the added sugar and calories while getting some extra fiber.\n\nWho should not get it: Those with certain digestive conditions should be careful about drinking prebiotic sodas. Make sure to consult your doctor first before giving them a try.\n\nWhy we like it: Launched by health and wellness brand Bloom Nutrition in July 2025, Bloom Pop is a prebiotic soda made with only 20 calories and 3-4 grams of sugar per can. It's also caffeine-free and contains no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors.\n\nThe brand sent me all its flavors to try, and my favorites are Shirley Temple and raspberry lemonade. There's also strawberry cream, watermelon lime and classic orange, all of which are carbonated.\n\nWho is it best for: I'd recommend this soda alternative to people who want the added prebiotics. These flavors are also sweeter than other alternatives I've tried, so if you have a sweet tooth that isn't satisfied by other drinks on this list, Bloom Pop may work for you.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a digestive condition, talk to your doctor about whether prebiotic sodas are right for you.\n\nWhy we like it: In 2017, Recess was launched to provide drinks designed to calm you down . In addition to Recess, the brand’s hemp and adaptogen drink, there are also the magnesium and adaptogen Recess Mood, alcohol-free Recess Zero Proof and Recess Mood Powder lines.\n\nFor testing, Recess sent me its Recess Mood variety pack in the flavors strawberry rose, blood orange, peach ginger and black cherry. They contain magnesium l‑threonate, l‑theanine and lemon balm to help you relax and unwind. I genuinely enjoyed all of these drinks, but my favorite from the Mood line was strawberry rose.\n\nWho is it best for: The Recess Mood line is best for people who want a low-sugar, low-calorie drink that helps their body relax.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a health condition that affects your magnesium levels -- such as kidney failure or certain bleeding disorders -- or makes your body sensitive to magnesium, consult your doctor before trying this drink.\n\nWhy we like it: Inspired by the marine, nutrient-rich foods she grew up eating in Japan, Alissa Miky founded OoMee in 2019. \"OoMee harnesses the power of red seaweed that's been supporting wellness in Japan for over 400 years,” Miky tells CNET. “What makes our marine plant beverage unique is how it works with your body naturally -- the agar-agar (in red seaweed) provides satiety support to help you feel full and satisfied, while our proprietary Seabiotics blend supports overall wellness and balance. It's like having the ocean's ancient wisdom in a refreshingly modern format.”\n\nLow in sugar, 20 calories, vegan, gluten-free and with no artificial flavors or carbonation, OoMee is the only US company that has partnered with the market leader in Japanese agar-agar, which has created special processing technology to ensure high-quality agar-agar.\n\nThe brand sent me its three flavors to try, and I enjoyed both the taste and texture of them all, but my favorite is blueberry and elderflower.\n\nWho is it best for: I’d recommend this drink to anyone who’s looking for a fun, uncarbonated drink that’s low in calories and sugar, but still tastes great. It also doesn’t have a seaweed-y taste, so that’s nothing to worry about.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a digestive condition, talk to your doctor about whether a drink with fiber is right for you. I would also avoid this beverage if you have a seaweed or agar-agar allergy.\n\nWhy we like it: If you crave the nostalgic taste of a can of iced tea in the summer but don't want all that extra sugar, Halfday’s noncarbonated iced teas are a great alternative. Inspired by co-founder Kayvon Jahanbakhsh's battle with ulcerative colitis, Halfday was created to bring forth a new era of iced teas, with 6 grams of prebiotic fiber, lower calories and 3-5 grams of sugar.They're also vegan, gluten-free and Kosher Certified. Note that depending on the flavor, Halfday contains between 25-50mg of caffeine per can.\n\nI've tried the following flavors from the brand: lemon tea, peach tea, green tea, raspberry tea, sweet tea and classic half-and-half (a mix of iced tea and lemonade). The only one I haven't tried is the limited-edition tropical tea. My favorites are peach tea and the classic half-and-half.\n\nWho is it best for: Halfday would be great for anyone who loves iced tea but wants less sugar in their drink and extra prebiotic fiber added.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a digestive condition, talk to your doctor about whether you should consume prebiotic iced teas. Also, if you're sensitive to caffeine, Halfday may not be the right fit for you.\n\nWhy we like it: Health-Ade was founded in 2012 with the goal of making high-quality, tasty kombucha that was easy to buy. Since then, Health-Ade has become an iconic drink in the gut health space, with its immediately recognizable amber-colored bottles. The brand has expanded to offer kombucha in cans, glow-up kombucha with added benefits and the gut-healthy soda SunSip. Its drinks are vegan, organic, gluten-free and non-GMO.\n\nThe brand offers plenty of flavors. I’ve tried pink lady apple, mint limeade, berry lemonade and passionfruit tangerine, as well as the glow-up flavors strawberry and citrus immune boost. During the holiday season, the brand released its Health-Ade Holiday Cheers with ginger, vanilla and allspice flavors, and it was one of my favorites.\n\nWho is it best for: In terms of flavor, Health-Ade is great for anyone who enjoys tart flavors. The drink is also ideal for someone looking to improve their gut health with probiotics.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have any gut health issues, kombucha may not be right for you. Make sure to talk to your doctor before taking a sip. Health-Ade also contains 8-15mg of caffeine per serving, which is about the amount in a decaf cup of coffee, so exercise caution if you’re sensitive to caffeine.\n\nWhy we like it: Inspired by Brazil’s love of coconut water, Vita Coco was launched in 2003 to help make the beverage more mainstream in the US. The coconuts are sourced from small farms in tropical locations; flash-pasteurized, vitamin C and 1% sugar are added to maintain flavor and freshness before being packaged in a Tetra Pak.\n\nIn addition to its original flavor, Vita Coco offers pineapple and peach mango flavors. I’ve tried the pineapple, but sometimes it’s a bit too sweet for me. The brand also offers Farmers Organic coconut water, its only organic product, and Extra Coconut with coconut puree.\n\nVita Coco is a great option for staying hydrated without the added sugars and artificial dyes found in traditional sports and energy drinks. It is also packed with electrolytes.\n\nWho is it best for: If you aren’t looking for 100% raw coconut water that foregoes pasteurization and is more affordable than Harmless Harvest, Vita Coco may be the right coconut water for you.\n\nWho should not get it: This product is pasteurized, not organic (unless it's Farmers Organic) and contains 1% added sugar. If any of those factors bother you and you’d prefer the opposite, you may want to give Harmless Harvest a try, but you will pay more.\n\nWhy we like it: Harmless Harvest launched in 2011 with its organic coconut water, a great all-natural sports drink , which you’ll likely recognize as the “pink coconut water.” It is USDA organic, has a Fair For Life certification (for people-centered, ethical and responsible commercial partnerships), has 100% recycled plastic bottles, and its coconuts are regenerative organic certified at the bronze level. The drink also has one ingredient, Nam Hom coconuts grown in Thailand, with natural electrolytes and no added sugars. It starts clear but turns pink over time because its antioxidants naturally react with light. The brand also doesn’t thermally pasteurize its product.\n\nOf all its products, I’ve tried the Harmless Harvest Organic Coconut Water, Organic Sparkling Coconut Water and Organic Coconut Smoothie. My favorite is their original Organic Coconut Water, which has a lovely, fresh, pure flavor that I love to sip after a workout.\n\nWho is it best for: Harmless Harvest Organic Coconut Water is best for someone looking to spend a little more on coconut water, since it's 100% coconut water with no extra ingredients. It’s great for providing electrolytes before or after a workout.\n\nWho should not get it: People with health conditions sensitive to electrolytes like potassium should consult their doctor before consuming this beverage.\n\nWhy we like it: Vybes is a “mood drink” founded in 2018. It is made with magnesium glycinate, a highly absorbable form of magnesium designed to help the body manage stress and fight fatigue while giving you an energy boost. You may remember that Vybes used to sell CBD drinks, but these have been discontinued due to state regulations.\n\nI’ve tried both the pineapple passionfruit and blueberry mint flavors, and my body felt more relaxed right after I finished the drink. I also enjoyed the unique flavor combinations and thought they were tasty. Other flavors I haven’t tried include blackberry hibiscus, blood orange lime, peach ginger and strawberry lavender.\n\nWho is it best for: Vybes is great for anyone who wants a drink that helps their body relax and find balance. I like to treat myself to a bottle after a stressful day.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a medical condition that makes your body sensitive to magnesium, you may want to avoid this drink. Check with your doctor. It is sweetened with erythritol and stevia (no added sugar), and some people may be more sensitive to certain artificial sweeteners, which can cause GI upset. Also, note that the drink is more expensive, at around $7, making it less budget-friendly.\n\nWhy we like it: Founded in 2018 and loved by both Meghan Markle and Oprah, Clevr Blends creates instant plant-based SuperLattes and SuperTeas made with functional ingredients like adaptogens, probiotics, natural electrolytes and superfoods to help with mood, stress, sleep and energy.\n\nFrom its SuperLatte line, which can be made hot or iced, I’ve tried the matcha, chai, sleeptime, rose cocoa and golden latte. They also offer honey pistachio matcha, honey lavender matcha, coffee, mocha, London fog and chill chai. SuperTeas come in the flavors strawberry lemonade, yuzu lemonade and mango green. The promised effects of the chai, matcha and sleeptime SuperLattes were assessed during a 12-week, third-party clinical study.\n\nMy number-one favorite is the Golden SuperLatte made with turmeric. It is the best “golden milk” I’ve ever tasted and is a drink I keep repurchasing. My second favorite is the Clevr Blends matcha, but I’m sensitive to caffeine, so don’t repurchase often.\n\nWho is it best for: Clevr’s SuperLattes are best for people who want an instant hot beverage packed with adaptogens, mushrooms, probiotics and more.\n\nWho should not get it: If you're pregnant, breastfeeding or a kid, Clevr Blends states that you should consult your healthcare provider before consuming the beverage. If you're sensitive to monk fruit extract or erythritol, a sugar alcohol, you may also want to avoid this drink. Note that some of the brand’s beverages do contain caffeine.\n\nWhy we like it: Moment is one of the few drinks I’ve tried that claim to help calm you and actually delivers. The brand uses adaptogens like L-theanine and ashwagandha to support mindfulness and relaxation. Whenever I reach for one of these drinks, I start to feel calm in about 20 minutes. It also tastes incredibly delicious, almost like a dessert in a can without being overly sweet.\n\nWho is it best for: Anyone who wants a functional drink to unwind, especially in the afternoon or as part of their ritual before bed. I would also recommend it to people looking to cut caffeine or alcohol, as it makes a great mocktail, too.\n\nWho should not get it: If you have a known sensitivity to adaptogens or are already taking supplements that contain ashwagandha, it’s worth checking with your doctor first. Since the purpose of this drink is to help you relax, I also wouldn’t recommend it to anyone looking for a jolt of energy.\n\nWhy we like it: Erha is a functional drink that doesn’t just hydrate you, but also supports how you feel. It offers three drinks to support common pain points like restlessness, bloating and allergies. Whether you’re stomach is feeling achey, you’re a little stuffy or overstimulated, Erha’s Intention Set is crafted with plant-based ingredients that support those needs. I tried all three flavors and each one felt like a mini ritual in my daily routine.\n\nWho is it best for: People looking for relief from stomach issues, allergies or stress. This drink lineup provides everyday support.\n\nWho should not get it: The flavors are subtle and herbal, so if you like bold and sweet flavors, this drink is not for you.\n\nWhy we like it: Be Love offers hydration and functionality in a clean and elevated way. Each can delivers electrolytes, while other ingredients like magnesium help support mood and stress. I like that these drinks also help balance blood pH levels. I often reach for these after my workouts or when I need a break from writing, and they help me feel replenished without the sugar rush I feel after having energy drinks.\n\nWho is it best for: People looking for an electrolyte drink with clean ingredients. Also great for those looking for a post-workout recovery drink.\n\nWho should not get it: If you’re looking for a high-sodium or high-sugar electrolyte drink (the ones you’d use after endurance sports), Be Love may be too light.\n\nWhy we like it: I love everything about this beverage's branding; it really flips the script on what a wellness drink should look like. It’s just water (or flavored still and sparkling water) in a tall can that looks like it belongs at a heavy metal concert. Branding aside, I like to keep these in my fridge for whenever I’m bored with plain water. The flavored options aren’t loaded with added sugars, and the still water version tastes super crisp.\n\nWho is it best for: Ideal for those who want to avoid sugary drinks, or even those who want to limit drinking alcohol but miss the feeling of a tallboy can.\n\nWho should not get it: Not for folks looking to get extra nutritional benefits (like added vitamins or adaptogens).\n\nWhen it comes to picking the right healthy beverage for your taste and preferences, there are multiple factors to consider. Below, we outline them so you can find the right drink for you.\n\nIf you follow a specific diet or are looking for specific ingredients, this can help you narrow down the best drink for you. Examples include gluten-free, vegan, nut-free, low-sugar or zero-sugar, and no artificial flavors or sweeteners. You’ll also want to think about what is added to the drink, such as magnesium, different botanicals, adaptogens and electrolytes and which would best suit your lifestyle or health concerns.\n\nAmelia Ti , a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of CNET's Medical Review Board, adds, “Some adaptogens, for instance, may not be suitable for pregnant people or those on certain medications.”\n\nSome healthy beverages cost more than others, especially if you want to buy a pack. Consider your budget, how many people you’re buying for and how often you plan to purchase these drinks. It’s also helpful to think about how often you buy a coffee, tea, juice or smoothie from a local establishment. Perhaps buying these beverages in their place will help you save.\n\nDo you plan to buy just one can of your favorite healthy beverage when grocery shopping? Or, do you want to buy a 6- or 12-pack for your entire family? Think about how many people you’re shopping for and how often you want to sip the beverage. Also, if you plan to keep them cold, think about how much space you have available in your refrigerator.\n\nThe best part of trying new beverages is finding your favorite flavor. If you’re trying to reduce your soda intake, perhaps you want a drink that replicates your favorite soda flavor. Or, if you prefer bold, fruity flavors, consider drinks that offer those. The best part is that there is truly a flavor for everyone.\n\nDo you like sparkling beverages or prefer your drinks still? This will also help you narrow down your selection. If you like healthier carbonated beverages because you want to cut back on soda, consider something sparkling. However, if you don’t like the feel of carbonation, a still coconut water might be more your speed.\n\nAs wellness editors and writers, we have spent years testing healthy beverages to see what they offer, if they fulfill their promises and if they taste good. We narrowed it down to the specific drinks that have stood out to us and that we would continue to purchase again and again. Factors we considered were dietary notes, added ingredients, price, carbonation, the drink category and sizes available.\n\nWhile everyone should make sure they’re drinking enough water every day, other healthy beverages include green tea , kombucha, kefir , fruit smoothies and coconut water.\n\nWater is the best liquid to drink every day because it is essential for your body to function.\n\nDrinks high in electrolytes, like coconut water, are great for replenishing your body and helping you rehydrate, especially after a workout.\n\n\"'Unhealthy' can be subjective since it can be dependent on one's medical conditions,” says Ti. \"Most unhealthy drinks are those high in added sugars, artificial ingredients or stimulants with no nutritional value, like sugary sodas or highly caffeinated energy drinks.”",
